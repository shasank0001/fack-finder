  title: macOS Tahoe review -- glossy changes mask genuine improvements
  content: The Liquid Glass look of the new
macOS Tahoe
is the first thing a user sees, but the appearance isn't only aesthetic, it comes with new features and improves existing ones.
In previous years, Apple has sometimes dialled back its macOS changes between the first developer beta and its eventual public release. But even the earliest look at a new macOS brings most of what it will be like to use as official operating system of the
Mac
.
So while details may change, and there are clear areas where improvement is needed, it's already possible to say that macOS Tahoe is a step forward for the Mac. It may not be the enormous leap that Apple claims, or as big an improvement as has come to
iPadOS 26
, but it's a definitely and marked improvement.
macOS Tahoe review: Liquid Glass
Apple describes the whole visual redesign of the Mac as being the use of the same Liquid Glass metaphor it has now brought to all its platforms. It means that windows are slightly rounder, which is purely a subjective improvement, but it also means that elements of the design are clearer.
Text in menus, for instance, seems to be slightly smaller yet is definitely more spaced out vertically. Spotting the menu item wanted is therefore easier, and choosing it is quicker, too.
In most cases, Liquid Glass is about making Mac design elements clearer and it is definitely the case that Finder and application windows appear more prominent than before.
It's more obvious when every window has the new design, but Liquid Glass has rounded off corners
There is the issue of the menu bar which is now completely transparent, making it seem more as if controls just happen to be lined up in a row at the top of the screen.
This isn't the first time Apple has tried something like this —  back in 2007 it introduced a
translucent menu bar
with Mac OS X Leopard. That was an immediate failure because it so often meant that menu items were obscured by the wallpaper behind them, and so Apple backed away from the idea.
It's back now, and it's better. With a total absence of a menu bar horizontal graphic, items ought to be even more lost in the background, but they are not.
Instead, Apple has made them pop out into the foreground and they have remained clear regardless of any wallpaper
AppleInsider
tried.
Controls in the Liquid Glass redesign are rounder and, here in video scrubbing, also bigger
The result is, as Apple says, a sense that your screen is bigger. But as part of that same aim, macOS Tahoe optionally offers transparent app icons in the dock, and that is less successful.
It certainly contributes to the sense of your work taking up the majority of the screen, and all controls being present yet also out of the way. But after a week of constantly struggling to work out which transparent app icon was which, this is one option
AppleInsider
switched off.
Left: Pages menu in macOS Tahoe. Right: the same menu in macOS Sequoia
In both transparent and in full color, though, the dock's apps have been redesigned and do appear neater.
macOS Tahoe review: Launchpad is gone
It's possible that you've never heard of Launchpad, either the term or the feature, because it was an idea that just never quite became mainstream. Nonetheless, there were users who liked it, and it used to be that clicking on the Launchpad icon in the dock would dim the screen to present a kind of Mac equivalent of the
iPhone
's screen.
Launchpad has been replaced by Apps —  which is also available now in Spotlight
That was a series of app icons, arranged in rows and columns. Compared to the iPhone, though, the app icons were very large and either swiping or searching through them was a bit tedious.
Now it's gone and its place in the dock is taken by a new icon called Apps. On the surface of it, the new Apps control presents a much smaller, much neater display of app icons that is arranged to be more useful.
So at the top there are a list of suggested apps that the Mac believes you're most likely to want next —  based on at least how often you use them, possibly also on the time of day.
Then underneath the suggested apps, are rows of others divided into categories. What you see depends on how many apps, and what sort you have, but for example, on
AppleInsider
Apps shows 14 categories, ranging from Creativity or Business, to Travel and Games.
What's really happened here, though, is that Launchpad's duties have been handed over to Spotlight. They are now just one of the many improvements to Apple's Spotlight app launcher.
macOS Tahoe review: Spotlight changes
By default, you still launch Spotlight by pressing Command-Space, and at first it looks like an only mildly redesigned version. The edges on the bar that appears are rounder and the whole thing feels smaller.
But press the tab key or move your mouse, and the old Spotlight bar contracts, while adding four new bubble-like options beside it. The first of these is called Applications, and clicking on it —  or pressing Command-1 —  opens up exactly the same window as the Apps icon in the dock.
Overall, Spotlight appears to be quite considerably improved in macOS Tahoe, and that's obviously welcome. It's also a little hard to quantify as results depend on what you search for.
Spotlight now gives you access to hundreds of Mac actions —  and any of them can be assigned a Quick Key
However, as well as a general sense of it being more useful and even more responsive, there is one clear improvement. Once you have searched for something in Spotlight, the results are headed by a series of buttons that filter the list.
The buttons vary, too, depending at least what apps you have, if not also the type of item you're searching for. But for example, typical filter buttons include PDF, Folders, Notes, and if you have them, apps such as Pixelmator Pro.
All of this happens in the main Spotlight window, but there are those four extra bubbles:
Applications (Command-1)
Files (Command-2)
Actions  (Command-3)
Clipboard (Command-4)
Applications, again, is that same list you get from the Apps icon in the Dock. Files does not as yet seem to be enormously different from a regular Spotlight search, except that by default it returns results in icon view instead of a list.
Then Actions is a potentially huge addition to Spotlight, but it's curiously named, and also has a curious icon. The icon is the same one as used for Shortcuts, and "actions" are the Shortcuts term for steps in a task.
It makes sense once you start searching because the first results shown can well be Shortcuts, if those happen to match your search terms. But Spotlight's Actions section also returns other results, so perhaps a better name for this would be
Quick Keys
.
That's because Quick Keys is the name Apple gives, not to these actions, but to what you can do with those actions. Against just about any search result that Actions shows up, you can assign a sequence of letters.
It's hard to describe that without saying shortcut, and it isn't the same as a Shortcut with a capital S. It's also not truly a keystroke, as those are normally a single letter plus a modifier key such as Command or Control.
If you try setting up a Quick Key that includes, say, the Command key, then you are immediately thrown out of the setup. Quick Keys have to be a sequence of letters or digits, up to 12 of them —  and you can't use punctuation.
The idea is that it's easy to remember that you've set, say "sm" to mean Send Message. And once you have such Quick Keys set, you can launch Spotlight, type "sm," hit Return, and be off composing a message.
That's the real benefit here. You are sending a message, or an email, but you're doing it from within Spotlight —  so you're doing it just about as fast as pressing Command-Space.
Plus keeping you within Spotlight means you might have fewer email options, but you're not in Mail. And so you're not distracted by incoming messages.
macOS Tahoe review: Clipboard
It's easy to get too excited over this last new part of Spotlight, the Clipboard, because it's a feature that pro users have had for decades and it should always have been available to everyone.
So it is little short of brilliant that Apple has brought it to everyone —  but as it turns out, a little short is right. This is a limited clipboard history and Apple's version is not as good as any of the third-party rivals.
Normally you'd say a Clipboard Manager is an unbeatable boon for the Mac, but Apple's version is beaten by all rivals
The basics are the same. This is copy and paste, except that what you paste might be the last thing you copied, but it could be the thing before that, or the thing before that, and so on.
You choose what to paste from everything you've copied in any app, whether that's text or an image —  or even a password.
Where rivals such as Alfred 5 will not copy a password, or will quickly erase it, Apple's version is not yet able to match that. Apple even gives a warning that the clipboard could contain sensitive information and so far in
AppleInsider
testing it is routine to find that your passwords are there in plain view.
Apple does make one concession to security, though. It's just not a great one —  macOS Tahoe wipes the clipboard history after eight hours.
So if you have standard blocks of text you always use, or just you lost the document you wrote yesterday but you know you copied it first, you're out of luck. Unless you have a third-party clipboard manager.
Apple has chosen to make these limitations for the same reason that it always does. Apple Reminders, for instance, may be excellent, but it can't replace Todoist or OmniFocus, because Apple prefers simplicity to powerful features.
Even so, a first-party clipboard manager on the Mac is a great thing and very definitely one of the reasons macOS Tahoe can make you
more productive
.
macOS Tahoe review —  Journal
There are more such features for productivity than Spotlight, but they're arguably more niche. One is the long-awaited addition of Journal to the Mac, and the other is the unexpected but welcome inclusion of a new Phone app.
Neither is yet ideal, and neither is yet what you can reasonably expect it to become over the next few years, if not just over the next months of the beta.
Journal for Mac is a little barebones next to its iPhone counterpart, but at least it's here
Journal, for instance, is a slightly stripped down version of the iPhone's app. The chief difference is that there is absolutely no Shortcuts support for Journal on the Mac
On the iPhone, for instance, you can create Shortcuts for adding entries automatically, including audio ones, or for searching through old entries.
Then manually adding an entry to Journal can begin with the iPhone prompting you with suggestions such as workouts or photos. On the Mac, you just start with a blank text field.
It is possible to add photos, audio, or location details. Plus if you have a camera on your Mac, you can directly take a photo or video into Journal.
The real benefit of Journal for the Mac, though, is the keyboard that you're bound to have with that device. Being able to write on a full-size keyboard is infinitely preferable to tapping away at the iPhone, especially for long entries.
So even without some of the extras Journal users may be used to, it's still a boon that the app is now on the Mac.
At this stage of the beta process, though, it is one feature that is noticeably buggy. It can take hours before Journal on the Mac is populated with your entries from the iPhone, although after that, syncing seems to be more reliable.
macOS Tahoe review —  Phone
The Phone is a curious but welcome addition to the Mac with macOS Tahoe. You've long been able to place calls from the Mac over, for instance,
FaceTime
or Skype, but now there's this new app.
It's buggy at the moment, but when it works, you may never want to make calls any other way than on your Mac
And it is specifically for making calls from your Mac, via your iPhone.
The first time you try it, though, you can be confused if you've ever made any form of call from the Mac before. In
AppleInsider
testing, for instance, Skype rose up like a ghost and tried to make the call before realising its service
no longer exists
.
To fix this:
Open the Phone app
Choose
Settings
Click on
General
Choose
Phone
from the
Default for calls
drop-down menu
With that set, being able to make actual phone calls from your Mac is an absolute boon —  in theory.
In practice, the Phone app for Mac is currently very buggy. In testing, it would usually show a notification when a call came in, but not always.
Go to the new Phone app and Settings to make sure you're not calling up the ghost of Skype past
For outgoing calls, sometimes it would drop the connection as soon as it was answered. It's always possible that this was an issue with the connection rather than the Phone app, but it's proven too inconsistent to be sure.
Nonetheless, when it does work, the call quality is excellent and it's actually hard to imagine going back to pick up your phone. As the beta progresses, hopefully this app will become more reliable, and as soon as it does, it will become heavily used.
There is one issue that doesn't seem likely to change since it's not truly a bug. But as yet there is no way to answer or end a call just from the keyboard.
It is possible to tell the third-party utility app Keyboard Maestro to look for the phone-is-ringing icon and then click on it. So by extension, it would be possible to have Stream Deck buttons that answer calls.
But as yet the Phone app is sufficiently unreliable that it's hard to even test out these options.
macOS Tahoe review —  Shortcuts
It's also maddeningly hard to try out certain Shortcuts features to do with tab groups in
Safari
. Shortcuts Actions to do exactly this were actually introduced in a late version of
macOS 15
, but such Actions are added so rarely that it was missed until now.
The idea is that you can have a Shortcut that opens Safari and switches the browser to a specified set of tabs. So with one button, you can have all your most used leisure sites open, but when you hear the boss coming, another single button or keystroke press switches to your work sites.
The full Shortcut for recording you speak and returning an actionable list of tasks —  image credit: William Gallagher
This has been possible on the iPhone for years. That would be the iPhone where the finger that taps such a button is resting about six pixels away from Safari's own tab controls.
And it has not been possible on the Mac, where arguably tab groups are more useable —  and a Shortcut would be that much more handy.
Such a set of Shortcut actions now exist, except for the small issue that they don't work. It's not a macOS Tahoe beta problem, either, as the same feature in
macOS Sequoia
's latest builds fails with the same "internal error."
What we do have in Shortcuts that has explicitly been launched with macOS Tahoe, and which does definitely work, is
Apple Intelligence
. Within Shortcuts on macOS Tahoe, you now have actions for specific Writing Tools:
Adjust Tone of Text
Make List from Text
Make Table from Text
Proofread Text
Rewrite Text
Summarise Text
Much, much more significant, though, is that there is also now a Shortcuts Action called
Use Model
.
This is the Action that gives you access to:
Apple Intelligence on device
Apple's Private Cloud Compute
Extensions such as ChatGPT
For now, only ChatGPT is offered in that third extension option, but presumably alternatives such as Google Gemini
will follow
.
But even now, you can pass anything like text or audio into a Shortcut and have a pre-written Apple Intelligence prompt to deal with it. Your choice then is which model to use, with on-device being the most private but also the least effective because of the limits on its size.
Using Apple's Private Cloud Compute means you get full-strength Apple Intelligence using the company's secure cloud service. And then there's ChatGPT, which means you do have your prompt passed to that service, but owner OpenAI doesn't get to keep it for training.
In practice, you do get considerably different results depending on which model you use, but the choice is yours. And you can either have the Shortcut automatically use your preference, or have it ask you each time you run it.
Apple gave an example of a student using this to parse their lecture notes and compare them to an audio of the session.
AppleInsider
has instead created a Shortcut that listens to you ramble on for ten minutes or more, then produces a coherent, actionable list of tasks based on what you said.
macOS Tahoe review —  what's coming next
The use of Apple Intelligence in Shortcuts is already working and extremely well. It's a way for users to benefit from Apple Intelligence by stringing together whole series of inputs and prompts, and it will mean Apple's AI getting more regular use.
Then it's already clear that the Phone app needs some work, and that it would be good if the Journal one saw some further care, too.
Otherwise, the most likely change that may come over the following months of the macOS Tahoe beta is a refinement of the Liquid Glass look. It's possible that some of the glass effects will be toned down before release.
But overall, the Liquid Glass redesign is here to stay. And since it comes with just a few really key Mac improvements, that's a very good thing —  if your Mac can run macOS Tahoe.
macOS Tahoe review —  system requirements
Apple has not release typical specifics such as the minimum RAM needed to run macOS Tahoe. But it does specify that the full operating system runs on Apple Silicon M1 Macs or later, and on certain Intel Macs.
The complete list of compatible Macs is:
iMac (2020 and later)
Mac mini (2020 and later)
Mac Pro (2019 and later)
Mac Studio (2022 and later)
MacBook Air with Apple Silicon (2020 and later)
MacBook Pro 13-Inch (2020, Four Thunderbolt 3 Ports)
MacBook Pro 16-Inch (2019)
MacBook Pro with Apple Silicon (2020 and later)
Note that this is the
last year
that any Intel Macs will be supported beyond security updates.
As with recent macOS updates, Intel Macs already get a more limited feature set. While this could conceivably change over the beta process, at present Intel Macs will certainly not get:
Apple Intelligence Writing Tools or Shortcuts actions
Live Translation
Polls in Messages
There is a question over Liquid Glass and to what degree Intel Macs will physically be able to support it. They are unlikely to get the full redesign with its faux background distortion, but according to Reddit, Apple
has even
brought Liquid Glass to the old Touch Bar.
There is a feature that is gone from even Apple Silicon Macs right now. As of macOS Tahoe, Apple
no longer supports
FireWire on Macs.
Long superseded by USB-C and Thunderbolt, FireWire is still in use through various hardware adapters. If the devices it connects are essential to your work, you can't update to macOS Tahoe.
macOS Tahoe review —  pros
Radically improved Spotlight with clipboard manager
New Phone app
Apple Intelligence actions in Shortcuts
Liquid Glass makes controls clearer
macOS Tahoe review —  cons
Transparent dock makes selecting apps harder
Journal is barebones
Shortcuts still lacks parity with iPhone in key actions
Rating: 4 out of 5
This is not a big bug-fix release, and for a while, the Liquid Glass redesign will be subverted by apps that have custom schemas —  we're looking at you Slack. There are still features that have been ported from the iPhone that aren't as good as they are on the iPhone.
Apple's attention that it is paying to macOS is perhaps not what it should be. That makes sense, we suppose, based on the huge gap between the number of iPhones sold, and the number of Macs sold annually.
It is not the worst update we've seen and it is not the best.
We'll revisit this review when the update ships in the fall of 2025.

OpenAI announces new contract with DoD
getty
OpenAI’s “OpenAI for Government” initiative, announced earlier this week on June 16, combines the company’s recently released ChatGPT Gov offering, custom frontier-AI models for national security, and a $200 million pilot with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD). It’s a clear signal that Washington sees AI as a strategic imperative, but it also raises urgent questions about bias, hallucinations, data sovereignty, and vendor lock-in.
What OpenAI Brings to Government
OpenAI says the package gives agencies “our best models in locked-down settings.” ChatGPT Gov runs on Microsoft’s Azure Government cloud and meets FedRAMP High and CJIS standards. NASA, Los Alamos and other labs already use it for research. In Minnesota, translators cut hours of work each week. Pennsylvania officials also say they save more than an hour per day on routine tasks.
The crown jewel of the launch is a one-year prototype agreement with the DoD’s Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office (CDAO) to explore AI in administration, military healthcare, and proactive cyber defense.
“This contract, with a $200 million ceiling, will bring OpenAI’s industry-leading expertise to help the Defense Department identify and prototype how frontier AI can transform its administrative operations, from improving how service members and their families get health care, to streamlining how they look at program and acquisition data, to supporting proactive cyber defense” OpenAI said in its announcement.
The one-year deal will test AI on forms, military medical records and cyber-attack warnings. AI can slash hours of data entry, simple analysis and translation. That frees analysts to focus on strategy. It can flag health risks in troop records or spot cyber threats before they hit.
MORE FOR YOU
“This contract will bring OpenAI’s industry-leading expertise to help the Defense Department identify and prototype how frontier AI can transform how it accomplishes its mission in service of the American people,” said Katrina Mulligan, a former Chief of Staff to the Secretary of the Army now at OpenAI.
But the Pentagon’s own AI experts worry. Lt. Gen. (ret.) Jack Shanahan, the former AI chief, warned that AI hallucinations, data-dependencies, and continuous human oversight might be a deal-breaker for intelligence work.
Big Benefits, Clear Dangers
AI can slash hours of data entry, simple analysis and translation. That frees analysts to focus on strategy. It can flag health risks in troop records or spot cyber threats before they hit.
OpenAI chased public-sector deals long before June 2025. In
October 2024
, Forbes detailed how the company pitched AI tools for battlefield logistics, compliance checks and cyber-defense to the Pentagon. Even then, some defense officials questioned whether the models were ready for sensitive military workflows.
But these solutions also have critical risks. Even locked-down clouds can’t stop the potential for leaked sensitive data. A clever query or a bug might reveal personal or classified info. These AI systems can also sometimes get critical facts wrong. AI sometimes invents answers. In a classified briefing, a made-up detail could derail decisions.
Likewise, the data that AI systems such as OpenAI’s GPT models are trained on may reinforce and exhibit existing data biases. They might misinterpret dialects or favor certain groups over others. Another concern is that of vendor lock-in. Once you build workflows around a proprietary AI, moving to another system costs time and money.
LLM Vendors Battle for Defense AI
While OpenAI’s $200 million DoD pilot gets big attention, competitors in the market aren’t standing still. Anthropic launched Claude Gov recently on June 6, Built with input from agency teams, it parses classified reports, flags cyber threats and keeps secret data locked down, even in high-security environments .
Likewise, Meta struck deals with Lockheed Martin, Palantir and others to run Llama in defense analytics and wargaming since last year. That move reversed its earlier hands-off stance and opened the door for Llama-powered simulations, decision-support tools and contractor workflows .
Google earned DoD IL6 certification in May 2025 to host Secret-level workloads on its air-gapped Distributed Cloud Hosted platform, including various aspects of its AI models. Cohere teamed with Canada and the U.K. on secure-AI projects, then joined forces with Second Front Systems to deliver “mission-ready” stacks, combining Cohere’s custom models with hardened deployment expertise for DoD customers .
Other Countries Go Their Own Way
Not every government wants U.S. AI in its back office. Singapore is investing S$70 million in SEA-LION, a multilingual, open-source model meant to handle Southeast Asian languages. Brussels is funding OpenEuroLLM and GenAI4EU to produce transparent models in all 24 official EU tongues.
North of the border, more than 5,000 Canadian civil servants are testing CANChat, an in-house chatbot that never leaves national cloud space. Meanwhile, France leans on BLOOM, a public-funded, 176-billion-parameter model that already runs inside several ministries. Taken as a whole, these projects show that AI sovereignty has moved from white papers to day-to-day policy.
Europe is also focused on building its own AI hubs. It has set aside billions for “AI gigafactories,” aiming to host tens of thousands of GPUs. Countries like France back home-grown startups such as Mistral AI. The European AI Act also forces strict checks on any system that affects jobs or legal rights.
India created AIKosha, a data platform for public agencies, and Bhashini, an open-source translator for dozens of local languages to help spread AI tools beyond big cities. Likewise, governments in Japan, New Zealand and Poland are testing their own models, tuned for local laws, languages and services.
Each path shows the same challenge: how to balance the benefits of AI with the requirements for control, openness and trust.
In the coming months, the real test will be whether OpenAI for Government can deliver measurable benefits at the DoD without tripping the ethical landmines that lie beneath.

OpenAI, Inc.
is an American
artificial intelligence
(AI) organization founded in December 2015 and headquartered in
San Francisco
, California. It aims to develop "safe and beneficial"
artificial general intelligence
(AGI), which it defines as "highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work".
[
6
]
As a leading organization in the ongoing
AI boom
,
[
7
]
OpenAI is known for the GPT family of
large language models
, the
DALL-E
series of
text-to-image models
, and a
text-to-video model
named
Sora
.
[
8
]
[
9
]
Its release of
ChatGPT
in November 2022 has been credited with catalyzing widespread interest in
generative AI
.
The organization has a complex corporate structure. As of April 2025, it is led by the
non-profit
OpenAI, Inc.,
[
1
]
registered in Delaware
, and has multiple for-profit subsidiaries including OpenAI Holdings, LLC and OpenAI Global, LLC.
[
10
]
Microsoft
has invested US$13 billion in OpenAI, and is entitled to 49% of OpenAI Global, LLC's profits, capped at an estimated 10x their investment.
[
11
]
[
12
]
Microsoft also provides computing resources to OpenAI through its
cloud platform
,
Microsoft Azure
.
[
13
]
In 2023 and 2024, OpenAI faced multiple lawsuits for alleged
copyright infringement
against authors and media companies whose work was used to train some of OpenAI's products. In November 2023, OpenAI's board
removed Sam Altman
as CEO, citing a lack of confidence in him, but reinstated him five days later following a reconstruction of the board. Throughout 2024, roughly half of then-employed
AI safety
researchers left OpenAI, citing the company's prominent role in an industry-wide problem.

History
[
edit
]
2015: founding and initial motivations
[
edit
]
Former headquarters at the
Pioneer Building
in San Francisco
In December 2015, OpenAI was founded by
Sam Altman
,
Elon Musk
,
Ilya Sutskever
,
Greg Brockman
,
Trevor Blackwell
, Vicki Cheung,
Andrej Karpathy
, Durk Kingma,
John Schulman
, Pamela Vagata, and
Wojciech Zaremba
, with Sam Altman and Elon Musk as the co-chairs.
[
16
]
A total of $1 billion in capital was pledged by Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, Elon Musk,
Reid Hoffman
,
Jessica Livingston
,
Peter Thiel
,
Amazon Web Services
(AWS),
Infosys
, and
YC Research
.
[
17
]
[
18
]
The actual collected total amount of contributions was only $130 million until 2019.
[
10
]
According to an investigation led by
TechCrunch
, while YC Research never contributed any funds,
Open Philanthropy
contributed $30 million and another $15 million in verifiable donations were traced back to Musk.
[
19
]
OpenAI later stated that Musk's contributions totaled less than $45 million.
[
20
]
The organization stated it would "freely collaborate" with other institutions and researchers by making its patents and research open to the public.
[
21
]
[
22
]
OpenAI was initially run from Brockman's living room.
[
23
]
It was later headquartered at the
Pioneer Building
in the
Mission District, San Francisco
.
[
24
]
[
25
]
According to OpenAI's charter, its founding mission is "to ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI)—by which we mean highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work—benefits all of humanity."
[
6
]
Musk and Altman stated in 2015 that they were partly motivated by concerns about
AI safety
and
existential risk from artificial general intelligence
.
[
26
]
[
27
]
OpenAI stated that "it's hard to fathom how much human-level AI could benefit society", and that it is equally difficult to comprehend "how much it could damage society if built or used incorrectly".
[
22
]
The startup also wrote that AI "should be an extension of individual human wills and, in the spirit of liberty, as broadly and evenly distributed as possible",
[
22
]
and that "because of AI's surprising history, it's hard to predict when human-level AI might come within reach. When it does, it'll be important to have a leading research institution which can prioritize a good outcome for all over its own self-interest."
[
28
]
Co-chair Sam Altman expected a decades-long project that eventually surpasses human intelligence.
[
29
]
Vishal Sikka
, former CEO of Infosys, stated that an "openness", where the endeavor would "produce results generally in the greater interest of humanity", was a fundamental requirement for his support; and that OpenAI "aligns very nicely with our long-held values" and their "endeavor to do purposeful work".
[
30
]
Cade Metz of
Wired
suggested that corporations such as
Amazon
might be motivated by a desire to use open-source software and data to level the playing field against corporations such as Google and Facebook, which own enormous supplies of proprietary data. Altman stated that Y Combinator companies would share their data with OpenAI.
[
29
]
2016–2018: Non-profit beginnings
[
edit
]
According to
Wired
, Brockman met with
Yoshua Bengio
, one of the "founding fathers" of
deep learning
, and drew up a list of the "best researchers in the field".
[
31
]
Brockman was able to hire nine of them as the first employees in December 2015.
[
31
]
In 2016, OpenAI paid corporate-level (rather than nonprofit-level) salaries, but did not pay AI researchers salaries comparable to those of
Facebook
or
Google
.
[
31
]
Microsoft's
Peter Lee
stated that the cost of a top AI researcher exceeds the cost of a top
NFL
quarterback prospect.
[
31
]
OpenAI's potential and mission drew these researchers to the firm; a Google employee said he was willing to leave Google for OpenAI "partly because of the very strong group of people and, to a very large extent, because of its mission."
[
31
]
Brockman stated that "the best thing that I could imagine doing was moving humanity closer to building real AI in a safe way."
[
31
]
OpenAI co-founder
Wojciech Zaremba
stated that he turned down "borderline crazy" offers of two to three times his market value to join OpenAI instead.
[
31
]
In April 2016, OpenAI released a public beta of "OpenAI Gym", its platform for
reinforcement learning
research.
[
32
]
Nvidia
gifted its first
DGX-1 supercomputer
to OpenAI in August 2016 to help it train larger and more complex AI models with the capability of reducing processing time from six days to two hours.
[
33
]
[
34
]
In December 2016, OpenAI released "Universe", a software platform for measuring and training an AI's general intelligence across the world's supply of games, websites, and other applications.
[
35
]
[
36
]
[
37
]
[
38
]
In 2017, OpenAI spent $7.9 million, or a quarter of its functional expenses, on cloud computing alone.
[
39
]
In comparison,
DeepMind
's total expenses in 2017 were $442 million. In the summer of 2018, simply training OpenAI's
Dota 2
bots required renting 128,000
CPUs
and 256
GPUs
from Google for multiple weeks.
In 2018, Musk resigned from his Board of Directors seat, citing "a potential future
conflict [of interest]
" with his role as CEO of
Tesla
due to Tesla's
AI development for self-driving cars.
[
40
]
Sam Altman claims that Musk believed that OpenAI had fallen behind other players like Google and Musk proposed instead to take over OpenAI himself, which the board rejected. Musk subsequently left OpenAI.
In February 2019,
GPT-2
was announced, which gained attention for its ability to generate human-like text.
[
41
]
2019: Transition from non-profit
[
edit
]
In 2019, OpenAI transitioned from non-profit to "capped" for-profit, with the profit being capped at 100 times any investment.
[
42
]
According to OpenAI, the capped-profit model allows OpenAI Global, LLC to legally attract investment from venture funds and, in addition, to grant employees stakes in the company.
[
43
]
Many top researchers work for
Google Brain
,
DeepMind
, or
Facebook
, which offer stock options that a nonprofit would be unable to.
[
44
]
Before the transition, public disclosure of the compensation of top employees at OpenAI was legally required.
[
45
]
The company then distributed
equity
to its employees and partnered with Microsoft,
[
46
]
announcing an investment package of $1 billion into the company. Since then, OpenAI systems have run on an
Azure
-based
supercomputing
platform from Microsoft.
[
47
]
[
48
]
[
49
]
OpenAI Global, LLC then announced its intention to commercially license its technologies.
[
50
]
It planned to spend the $1 billion "within five years, and possibly much faster".
[
51
]
Altman has stated that even a billion dollars may turn out to be insufficient, and that the lab may ultimately need "more capital than any non-profit has ever raised" to achieve artificial general intelligence.
[
52
]
The transition from a nonprofit to a capped-profit company was viewed with skepticism by
Oren Etzioni
of the nonprofit
Allen Institute for AI
, who agreed that wooing top researchers to a nonprofit is difficult, but stated "I disagree with the notion that a nonprofit can't compete" and pointed to successful low-budget projects by OpenAI and others. "If bigger and better funded was always better, then
IBM
would still be number one."
The nonprofit, OpenAI, Inc., is the sole
controlling shareholder
of OpenAI Global, LLC, which, despite being a for-profit company, retains a formal
fiduciary responsibility
to OpenAI, Inc.'s nonprofit charter. A majority of OpenAI, Inc.'s board is barred from having financial stakes in OpenAI Global, LLC.
[
43
]
In addition, minority members with a stake in OpenAI Global, LLC are barred from certain votes due to conflict of interest.
[
44
]
Some researchers have argued that OpenAI Global, LLC's switch to for-profit status is inconsistent with OpenAI's claims to be "democratizing" AI.
[
53
]
2020–2023: ChatGPT, DALL-E, partnership with Microsoft
[
edit
]
In 2020, OpenAI announced
GPT-3
, a language model trained on large internet datasets. GPT-3 is aimed at natural language answering questions, but it can also translate between languages and coherently generate improvised text. It also announced that an associated API, named simply "the API", would form the heart of its first commercial product.
[
54
]
Eleven employees left OpenAI, mostly between December 2020 and January 2021, in order to establish
Anthropic
.
[
55
]
In 2021, OpenAI introduced
DALL-E
, a specialized deep learning model adept at generating complex digital images from textual descriptions, utilizing a variant of the GPT-3 architecture.
[
56
]
The release of
ChatGPT
was a major event in the
AI boom
.  By January 2023, ChatGPT had become what was then the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users in two months.
[
57
]
In December 2022, OpenAI received widespread media coverage after launching a free preview of
ChatGPT
, its new AI
chatbot
based on GPT-3.5. According to OpenAI, the preview received over a million signups within the first five days.
[
58
]
According to anonymous sources cited by
Reuters
in December 2022, OpenAI Global, LLC was projecting $200 million of revenue in 2023 and $1 billion in revenue in 2024.
[
59
]
In January 2023, OpenAI Global, LLC was in talks for funding that would value the company at $29 billion, double its 2021 value.
[
60
]
On January 23, 2023, Microsoft announced a new US$10 billion investment in OpenAI Global, LLC over multiple years, partially needed to use Microsoft's cloud-computing service
Azure
.
[
61
]
[
62
]
Rumors of this deal suggested that Microsoft may receive 75% of OpenAI's profits until it secures its investment return and a 49% stake in the company.
[
63
]
The investment is believed to be a part of Microsoft's efforts to integrate OpenAI's ChatGPT into the Bing search engine. Google announced a similar AI application (
Bard
), after ChatGPT was launched, fearing that ChatGPT could threaten Google's place as a go-to source for information.
[
64
]
[
65
]
On February 7, 2023, Microsoft announced that it was building AI technology based on the same foundation as ChatGPT into
Microsoft Bing
,
Edge
,
Microsoft 365
and other products.
[
66
]
On March 3, 2023,
Reid Hoffman
resigned from his board seat, citing a desire to avoid conflicts of interest with his investments in AI companies via
Greylock Partners
, and his co-founding of the AI startup
Inflection AI
. Hoffman remained on the board of Microsoft, a major investor in OpenAI.
[
67
]
On March 14, 2023, OpenAI released
GPT-4
, both as an API (with a waitlist) and as a feature of ChatGPT Plus.
[
68
]
Altman and Sutskever at
Tel Aviv University
in 2023
On May 22, 2023, Sam Altman, Greg Brockman and Ilya Sutskever posted recommendations for the governance of
superintelligence
.
[
69
]
They consider that superintelligence could happen within the next 10 years, allowing a "dramatically more prosperous future" and that "given the possibility of existential risk, we can't just be reactive". They propose creating an international watchdog organization similar to
IAEA
to oversee AI systems above a certain capability threshold, suggesting that relatively weak AI systems on the other side should not be overly regulated. They also call for more technical safety research for superintelligences, and ask for more coordination, for example through governments launching a joint project which "many current efforts become part of".
[
69
]
[
70
]
In July 2023, OpenAI launched the superalignment project, aiming to find within 4 years how to
align
future superintelligences by automating alignment research using AI.
[
71
]
In August 2023, it was announced that OpenAI had acquired the
New York
-based start-up Global Illumination, a company that deploys AI to develop digital infrastructure and creative tools.
[
72
]
On September 21, 2023, Microsoft had begun rebranding all variants of its Copilot to
Microsoft Copilot
, including the former
Bing Chat
and the
Microsoft 365 Copilot
.
[
73
]
This strategy was followed in December 2023 by adding the MS-Copilot to many installations of
Windows 11
and
Windows 10
as well as a standalone
Microsoft Copilot app
released for
Android
[
74
]
and one released for
iOS
thereafter.
[
75
]
In October 2023, Sam Altman and Peng Xiao, CEO of the Emirati AI firm
G42
, announced Open AI would let G42 deploy Open AI technology.
[
76
]
On November 6, 2023, OpenAI launched GPTs, allowing individuals to create customized versions of ChatGPT for specific purposes, further expanding the possibilities of AI applications across various industries.
[
77
]
On November 14, 2023, OpenAI announced they temporarily suspended new sign-ups for ChatGPT Plus due to high demand.
[
78
]
Access for newer subscribers re-opened a month later on December 13.
[
79
]
2024: Public/Non-Profit Efforts, Sora, Partnership with Apple
[
edit
]
In January 2024, OpenAI partnered with
Arizona State University
to provide complete access to ChatGPT Enterprise in its first educational collaboration.
[
80
]
In February, amidst SEC probes and investigations into CEO Altman's communications
[
81
]
OpenAI unveiled its text-to-video model
Sora (text-to-video model)
, currently available to red teams for managing risks
[
82
]
[
83
]
On February 29, 2024,
Elon Musk
filed a lawsuit against OpenAI and CEO Sam Altman, accusing them of shifting focus from public benefit to profit maximization—a case OpenAI dismissed as “incoherent” and “frivolous,” though Musk later revived legal action against Altman and others in August 2024.
[
84
]
[
85
]
[
86
]
[
87
]
In May 2024, significant leadership changes occurred as Chief Scientist
Ilya Sutskever
resigned—being succeeded by
Jakub Pachocki
—and co-leader
Jan Leike
departed amid concerns over safety and trust.
[
88
]
[
89
]
That same month, OpenAI formed a partnership with
Reddit
to integrate its content into OpenAI products
[
90
]
and inked content deals with
News Corp
, along with licensing arrangements involving publishers such as
Axios
and
Vox Media
.
[
91
]
In June 2024, OpenAI joined forces with
Apple Inc.
to integrate ChatGPT features into
Apple Intelligence
and
iPhone
[
92
]
and added former NSA head
Paul Nakasone
to its board,
[
93
]
while acquiring Multi, a startup focused on remote collaboration.
[
94
]
In July 2024, Reuters reported that OpenAI was developing a project, codenamed 'Strawberry', to enhance AI reasoning—a project later released in September as the
o1
model.
[
95
]
[
96
]
In August 2024, cofounder John Schulman left to join rival startup
Anthropic
, and OpenAI's president
Greg Brockman
took extended leave until November.
[
97
]
In September 2024, OpenAI's global affairs chief endorsed the UK's “smart” AI regulation during testimony to a
House of Lords
committee,
[
98
]
Meanwhile, CTO
Mira Murati
announced her departure amid internal concerns.
[
99
]
[
100
]
In October 2024, OpenAI secured $6.6 billion in funding—valuing it at $157 billion—with major investors including Microsoft, Nvidia, and SoftBank,
[
101
]
It also acquired the domain Chat.com,
[
102
]
[
103
]
and saw the return of Greg Brockman after his brief absence.
[
104
]
In December 2024, during the "12 Days of OpenAI" event, the company launched the
Sora
model for ChatGPT Plus and Pro users,
[
105
]
[
106
]
It also launched the advanced
OpenAI o1
reasoning model
[
107
]
[
108
]
Additionally, ChatGPT Pro—a $200/month subscription service offering unlimited o1 access and enhanced voice features—was introduced, and preliminary benchmark results for the upcoming
OpenAI o3
models were shared.
[
109
]
2025
[
edit
]
On January 20, 2025,
DeepSeek
released the "DeepSeek-R1" model, which rivaled the performance of OpenAI's o1 and was open-weight.
[
110
]
DeepSeek claimed that this model only took $5.6 million to train. This news led to panic from investors and caused
Nvidia
to record the biggest single day market cap loss in history losing $589 billion on January 27.
[
111
]
On January 21, 2025, it was announced that OpenAI,
Oracle
,
SoftBank
and
MGX
would launch
The Stargate Project
, a joint venture to build an AI infrastructure system in conjunction with the
US government
. The project takes its name from OpenAI's existing "Stargate" supercomputer project and is estimated to cost $500 billion. The project will be funded over the next four years.
[
112
]
On January 23, OpenAI released
Operator
, an
AI agent
and web automation tool for accessing websites to execute goals defined by users. The feature was only available to Pro users in the United States.
[
113
]
[
114
]
On February 2, OpenAI made a
deep research agent
, that achieved an accuracy of 26.6 percent on
Humanity's Last Exam
(HLE) benchmark, available to $200-monthly-fee paying users with up to 100 queries per month, while more “limited access” was promised for Plus, Team and later Enterprise users.
[
115
]
In February, OpenAI underwent a rebranding with a new typeface, word mark, symbol and palette.
[
116
]
OpenAI began collaborating with
Broadcom
in 2024 to design a custom AI chip capable of both training and inference targeted for mass production in 2026 and to be manufactured by
TSMC
in 3 nm node. This initiative is intended to reduce OpenAI's dependence on Nvidia GPUs, which are costly and face high demand in the market.
[
117
]
On February 13, Sam Altman announced that GPT-4.5, internally known as "Orion", will be the last model without full chain-of-thought reasoning. Altman also indicated that GPT-5, expected to be released within months, could unify the O-Series and GPT-Series models, eliminating the need to choose between them and phasing out O-series models.
[
118
]
[
119
]
In March 2025, OpenAI signed an $11.9 billion agreement with
CoreWeave
, an Nvidia-backed, AI-focused cloud service provider. As part of the deal, OpenAI will receive $350 million worth of CoreWeave shares and gain access to its AI infrastructure, which includes over a quarter million NVIDIA GPUs.
[
120

,
Altimeter
, and
Thrive
.
[
121
]
[
122
]
On April 9, 2025, OpenAI countersued Musk in federal court, alleging that he had engaged in "bad-faith tactics" to slow the company's progress and seize its innovations for his personal benefit. OpenAI also argued that Musk had previously supported the creation of a for-profit structure and had expressed interest in controlling OpenAI himself. The countersuit seeks damages and legal measures to prevent further alleged interference.
[
123
]
In May 2025, it was reported that OpenAI had agreed to acquire "Windsurf", an AI-assisted coding tool formerly known as "Codeium", for approximately $3 billion.
[
124
]

In the early years before his 2018 departure, Musk posed the question: "What is the best thing we can do to ensure the future is good? We could sit on the sidelines or we can encourage regulatory oversight, or we could participate with the right structure with people who care deeply about developing AI in a way that is safe and is beneficial to humanity." He acknowledged that "there is always some risk that in actually trying to advance (friendly) AI we may create the thing we are concerned about"; but nonetheless, that the best defense was "to empower as many people as possible to have AI. If everyone has AI powers, then there's not any one person or a small set of individuals who can have AI superpower."
[
133
]
Musk and Altman's counterintuitive strategy—that of trying to reduce the potential harm of AI by giving everyone access to it—is controversial among those concerned with existential risk from AI. Philosopher
Nick Bostrom
said, "If you have a button that could do bad things to the world, you don't want to give it to everyone."
[
27
]
During a 2016 conversation about
technological singularity
, Altman said, "We don't plan to release all of our source code" and mentioned a plan to "allow wide swaths of the world to elect representatives to a new governance board". Greg Brockman stated, "Our goal right now
... is to do the best thing there is to do. It's a little vague."
[
142
]
Conversely, OpenAI's initial decision to withhold GPT-2 around 2019, due to a wish to "err on the side of caution" in the presence of potential misuse, was criticized by advocates of openness. Delip Rao, an expert in text generation, stated, "I don't think [OpenAI] spent enough time proving [GPT-2] was actually dangerous." Other critics argued that open publication was necessary to replicate the research and to create countermeasures.
[
143
]
More recently, in 2022, OpenAI published its approach to the
alignment problem
, anticipating that aligning
AGI
to human values would likely be harder than aligning current AI systems: "Unaligned AGI could pose substantial risks to humanity[,] and solving the AGI alignment problem could be so difficult that it will require all of humanity to work together". They stated that they intended to explore how to better use human feedback to train AI systems, and how to safely use AI to incrementally automate alignment research.
[
144
]
In 2024, following the temporary removal of Sam Altman and his return, many employees gradually left OpenAI, including most of the original leadership team and a significant number of AI safety researchers.
[
145
]
[
146
]
OpenAI also planned a restructuring to operate as a for-profit company. This restructuring could grant Altman a stake in the company.
[
147
]
In March 2025, OpenAI made a policy proposal for the Trump administration to
preempt
pending AI-related state laws with federal laws.
[
148
]
According to OpenAI, "This framework would extend the tradition of government receiving learnings and access, where appropriate, in exchange for providing the private sector relief from
the 781 and counting proposed AI-related bills already introduced this year in US states."
[
149
]
Stance on China
[
edit
]
In February 2025, OpenAI CEO
Sam Altman
stated that the company is interested in collaborating with the
People's Republic of China
, despite
regulatory restrictions imposed by the U.S. government
.
[
150
]
This shift comes in response to the growing influence of the Chinese artificial intelligence company
DeepSeek
, which has disrupted the AI market with open models, including DeepSeek V3 and DeepSeek R1.
[
151
]
[
152
]
The emergence of DeepSeek has led major Chinese tech firms such as
Baidu
and others to embrace an
open-source
strategy, intensifying competition with OpenAI. Altman acknowledged the uncertainty regarding U.S. government approval for AI cooperation with China but emphasized the importance of fostering dialogue between technological leaders in both nations.

Firing of Altman
[
edit
]
Further information:
Removal of Sam Altman from OpenAI
On November 17, 2023, Sam Altman was removed as CEO when its board of directors (composed of
Helen Toner
,
Ilya Sutskever
,
Adam D'Angelo
and Tasha McCauley) cited a lack of confidence in him. Chief Technology Officer
Mira Murati
took over as interim CEO.
Greg Brockman
, the president of OpenAI, was also removed as chairman of the board
[
156
]
[
157
]
and resigned from the company's presidency shortly thereafter.
[
158
]
Three senior OpenAI researchers subsequently resigned: director of research and GPT-4 lead Jakub Pachocki, head of AI risk
Aleksander Mądry
[
pl
]
, and researcher Szymon Sidor.
[
159
]
[
160
]
On November 18, 2023, there were reportedly talks of Altman returning as CEO amid pressure placed upon the board by investors such as Microsoft and
Thrive Capital
, who objected to Altman's departure.
[
161
]
Although Altman himself spoke in favor of returning to OpenAI, he has since stated that he considered starting a new company and bringing former OpenAI employees with him if talks to reinstate him didn't work out.
[
162
]
The board members agreed "in principle" to resign if Altman returned.
[
163
]
On November 19, 2023, negotiations with Altman to return failed and Murati was replaced by
Emmett Shear
as interim CEO.
[
164
]
The board initially contacted
Anthropic
CEO
Dario Amodei
(a former OpenAI executive) about replacing Altman, and proposed a
merger
of the two companies, but both offers were declined.
[
165
]
On November 20, 2023, Microsoft CEO
Satya Nadella
announced Altman and Brockman would be joining Microsoft to lead a new advanced AI research team, but added that they were still committed to OpenAI despite recent events.
[
166
]
Before the partnership with Microsoft was finalized, Altman gave the board another opportunity to negotiate with him.
[
167
]
About 738 of OpenAI's 770 employees, including Murati and Sutskever, signed an open letter stating they would quit their jobs and join Microsoft if the board did not rehire Altman and then resign.
[
168
]
[
169
]
This prompted OpenAI investors to consider legal action against the board as well.
[
170
]
In response, OpenAI management sent an internal memo to employees stating that negotiations with Altman and the board had resumed and would take some time.
[
171
]
On November 21, 2023, after continued negotiations, Altman and Brockman returned to the company in their prior roles along with a reconstructed board made up of new members
Bret Taylor
(as chairman) and
Lawrence Summers
, with D'Angelo remaining.
[
172
]
On November 22, 2023, emerging reports suggested that Sam Altman's dismissal from OpenAI may have been linked to his alleged mishandling of a significant breakthrough in the organization's secretive project codenamed Q*. According to sources within OpenAI, Q* is aimed at developing AI capabilities in logical and mathematical reasoning, and reportedly involves performing math on the level of grade-school students.
[
173
]
[
174
]
[
175
]
Concerns about Altman's response to this development, specifically regarding the discovery's potential safety implications, were reportedly raised with the company's board shortly before Altman's firing.
[
176
]
On November 29, 2023, OpenAI announced that an anonymous Microsoft employee had joined the board as a non-voting member to observe the company's operations;
[
177
]
Microsoft resigned from the board in July 2024.
[

Content moderation contract with Sama
[
edit
]
For broader coverage of this topic, see
Content moderation and working conditions
.
In January 2023, OpenAI has been criticized for outsourcing the
annotation of data sets
to
Sama
, a company based in San Francisco that employed workers in
Kenya
. These annotations were used to train an AI model to detect toxicity, which could then be used to
moderate toxic content
, notably from ChatGPT's training data and outputs. However, these pieces of text usually contained detailed descriptions of various types of violence, including sexual violence. The investigation uncovered that OpenAI began sending snippets of data to Sama as early as November 2021. The four Sama employees interviewed by
Time
described themselves as mentally scarred. OpenAI paid Sama $12.50 per hour of work, and Sama was redistributing the equivalent of between $1.32 and $2.00 per hour post-tax to its annotators. Sama's spokesperson said that the $12.50 was also covering other implicit costs, among which were infrastructure expenses, quality assurance and management.
[
179
]
Lack of technological transparency
[
edit
]
In March 2023, the company was also criticized for disclosing particularly few technical details about products like GPT-4, contradicting its initial commitment to openness and making it harder for independent researchers to replicate its work and develop safeguards. OpenAI cited competitiveness and safety concerns to justify this strategic turn. OpenAI's former chief scientist Ilya Sutskever argued in 2023 that open-sourcing increasingly capable models was increasingly risky, and that the safety reasons for not open-sourcing the most potent AI models would become "obvious" in a few years.
[
180
]
Non-disparagement agreement
[
edit
]
On May 17, 2024, a
Vox
article reported that OpenAI was asking departing employees to sign a lifelong
non-disparagement agreement
forbidding them from criticizing OpenAI or acknowledging the existence of the agreement.
Daniel Kokotajlo
, a former employee, publicly stated that he forfeited his vested equity in OpenAI in order to leave without signing the agreement.
[
181
]
[
182
]
Sam Altman stated that he was unaware of the equity cancellation provision, and that OpenAI never enforced it to cancel any employee's vested equity.
[
183
]
Vox published leaked documents and emails challenging this claim.
[
184
]
On May 23, 2024, OpenAI sent a memo releasing former employees from the agreement.
[
185
]
Proposed shift from nonprofit control
[
edit
]
OpenAI, Inc. was originally designed as a nonprofit in order to ensure that AGI "benefits all of humanity" rather than "the private gain of any person". In 2019, it created OpenAI Global, LLC, a capped-profit subsidiary controlled by the nonprofit. In December 2024, OpenAI proposed a restructuring plan to convert the capped-profit into a Delaware-based
public benefit corporation
(PBC), and to release it from the control of the nonprofit. The nonprofit would sell its control and other assets, getting equity in return, and would use it to fund and pursue separate charitable projects, including in science and education. OpenAI's leadership described the change as necessary to secure additional investments, and claimed that the nonprofit's founding mission to ensure AGI "benefits all of humanity" would be better fulfilled.
[
186
]
The plan has been criticized by experts and former employees. A legal letter named "
Not For Private Gain
" asked the
attorneys general of California
and
Delaware
to intervene, stating that the restructuring is illegal and would remove governance safeguards from the nonprofit and the attorneys general.
[
187
]
The letter argues that OpenAI's complex structure was deliberately designed to remain accountable to its mission, without the conflicting pressure of maximizing profits. It contends that the nonprofit is best positioned to advance its mission of ensuring AGI benefits all of humanity by continuing to control OpenAI Global, LLC, whatever the amount of equity that it could get in exchange.
[
188
]
PBCs can choose how they balance their mission with profit-making. Controlling shareholders have a large influence on how closely a PBC sticks to its mission.
[
189
]
[
188
]
Legally, under nonprofit law, assets dedicated to a charitable purpose must continue to serve that purpose. To change its purpose, OpenAI would have to prove that its current purposes have become unlawful, impossible, impracticable, or wasteful.
[
190
]
Elon Musk, who had initiated a lawsuit against OpenAI and Altman in August 2024 alleging the company violated contract provisions by prioritizing profit over its mission, reportedly leveraged this lawsuit to stop the restructuring plan.
[
189
]
On February 10, 2025, a consortium of investors led by Elon Musk submitted a $97.4 billion unsolicited bid to buy the nonprofit that controls OpenAI, declaring willingness to match or exceed any better offer.
[
191
]
[
192
]
The offer was rejected on 14 February 2025, with OpenAI stating that it was not for sale,
[
193
]
but the offer complicated Altman's restructuring plan by suggesting a lower bar for how much the nonprofit should be valued.
[
192
]
In May 2025, the nonprofit's board chairman
Bret Taylor
announced that the nonprofit would renounce plans to cede control after outside pressure. The capped-profit still plans to transition to a PBC,
[
194
]
which critics said would diminish the nonprofit's control.

OpenAI was sued for
copyright infringement
by authors
Sarah Silverman
,
Matthew Butterick
,
Paul Tremblay
and
Mona Awad
in July 2023.
[

In September 2023, 17 authors, including
George R. R. Martin
,
John Grisham
,
Jodi Picoult
and
Jonathan Franzen
, joined the
Authors Guild
in filing a class action lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging that the company's technology was illegally using their copyrighted work.
[
199
]
[
200
]
The
New York Times
also sued the company in late December 2023.
[
197
]
[
201
]
In May 2024 it was revealed that OpenAI had destroyed its Books1 and Books2 training datasets, which were used in the
training of GPT-3
, and which the Authors Guild believed to have contained over 100,000 copyrighted books.
[
202
]
In 2021, OpenAI developed a
speech recognition
tool called Whisper. OpenAI used it to transcribe more than one million hours of YouTube videos into text for training GPT-4. The automated transcription of YouTube videos raised concerns within OpenAI employees regarding potential violations of YouTube's terms of service, which prohibit the use of videos for applications independent of the platform, as well as any type of automated access to its videos. Despite these concerns, the project proceeded with notable involvement from OpenAI's president,
Greg Brockman
. The resulting dataset proved instrumental in training GPT-4.
[
203
]
In February 2024,
The Intercept
as well as
Raw Story
and Alternate Media Inc. filed lawsuit against OpenAI on copyright litigation ground.
[
204
]
[
205
]
The lawsuit is said to have charted a new legal strategy for digital-only publishers to sue OpenAI.
[
206
]
On April 30, 2024, eight newspapers filed a lawsuit in the
Southern District of New York
against OpenAI and Microsoft, claiming illegal harvesting of their copyrighted articles. The suing publications included
The Mercury News
,
The Denver Post
,
The Orange County Register
,
St. Paul Pioneer Press
,
Chicago Tribune
,
Orlando Sentinel
,
Sun Sentinel
, and
New York Daily News

GDPR compliance
[
edit
]
In April 2023, the EU's
European Data Protection Board
(EDPB) formed a dedicated task force on ChatGPT "to foster cooperation and to exchange information on possible enforcement actions conducted by data protection authorities" based on the "enforcement action undertaken by the Italian data protection authority against Open AI about the Chat GPT service".
[
208
]
In late April 2024
NOYB
filed a complaint with the
Austrian
Datenschutzbehörde against OpenAI for violating the European
General Data Protection Regulation
. A text created with ChatGPT gave a false
date of birth
for a living person without giving the individual the option to see the personal data used in the process. A request to correct the mistake was denied. Additionally, neither the recipients of ChatGPT's work nor the sources used, could be made available, OpenAI claimed.
[
209
]
Use by military
[
edit
]
OpenAI was criticized for lifting its ban on using ChatGPT for "military and warfare". Up until January 10, 2024, its "usage policies" included a ban on "activity that has high risk of physical harm, including", specifically, "weapons development" and "military and warfare". Its new policies prohibit "[using] our service to harm yourself or others" and to "develop or use weapons".
[
210
]
[
211

As one of the industry collaborators, OpenAI provides
LLMs
to the
Artificial Intelligence Cyber Challenge
(AIxCC), which is sponsored by the
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency
(DARPA), and to the
Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health
.
[
212
]
In October 2024,
The Intercept
revealed that OpenAI's tools are considered "essential" for
AFRICOM
's mission and included in an "Exception to Fair Opportunity" contractual agreement between the
United States Department of Defense
and
Microsoft
.
[
213
]
In December 2024, OpenAI said it would partner with defense-tech company
Anduril
to build drone defense technologies for the United States and its allies.
[
214
]
In 2025, OpenAI's Chief Product Officer,
Kevin Weil
, was commissioned
lieutenant colonel
in the
U.S. Army
to join
Detachment 201
as senior advisor.
[
215
]
In June 2025, the U.S. Department of Defense awarded OpenAI a $200 million one-year contract to develop AI tools for military and national security applications. OpenAI announced a new program, OpenAI for Government, to give federal, state, and local governments access to its models, including ChatGPT.
[

Data scraping
[
edit
]
In June 2023, a lawsuit claimed that OpenAI scraped 300 billion words online without consent and without registering as a data broker. It was filed in
San Francisco
,
California
, by sixteen anonymous plaintiffs.
[
218
]
They also claimed that OpenAI and its partner as well as customer
Microsoft
continued to unlawfully collect and use personal data from millions of consumers worldwide to train artificial intelligence models.
[
219
]
On May 22, 2024, OpenAI entered into an agreement with
News Corp
to integrate news content from
The Wall Street Journal
, the
New York Post
,
The Times
, and
The Sunday Times
into its AI platform. Meanwhile, other publications like
The New York Times
chose to sue OpenAI and
Microsoft
for copyright infringement over the use of their content to train AI models.
[
220

In November 2024, a coalition of Canadian news outlets, including the
Toronto Star
,
Metroland Media
,
Postmedia
,
The Globe and Mail
,
The Canadian Press
and
CBC
, sued OpenAI for using their news articles to train its software without permission.

Suicide of Suchir Balaji
[
edit

Further information:
Suchir Balaji
Suchir Balaji
, a former researcher at OpenAI, was found dead in his San Francisco apartment on November 26, 2024. Independent investigations carried out by the San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) and the San Francisco Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) concluded that Balaji shot himself.
[
222
]
The death occurred 34 days after a
New York Times
interview in which he accused OpenAI of violating copyright law in developing its commercial LLMs, one of which (GPT-4) he had helped engineer. He was also a likely witness in a major copyright trial against the AI company, and was one of several of its current or former employees named in
The New York Times
'
s court filings as potentially having documents relevant to the case. The death led to speculation and conspiracy theories suggesting he had been deliberately silenced.
[
222
]
[
223
]
Elon Musk
,
Tucker Carlson
, California Congressman
Ro Khanna
, and San Francisco Supervisor
Jackie Fielder
have publicly echoed Balaji's parents' skepticism and calls for an investigation.
[
224

In February 2025, the OCME autopsy and SFPD police reports were released. A joint letter from both agencies to the parents' legal team noted that he had purchased the firearm used two years prior to his death, and had recently searched for brain anatomy information on his computer. The letter also highlighted that his apartment's only entrance was dead-bolted from inside with no signs of forced entry.

Why did OpenAI choose to release an API instead of open-sourcing the models?
There are three main reasons we did this. First, commercializing the technology helps us pay for our ongoing AI research, safety, and policy efforts. Second, many of the models underlying the API are very large, taking a lot of expertise to develop and deploy and making them very expensive to run. This makes it hard for anyone except larger companies to benefit from the underlying technology. We're hopeful that the API will make powerful AI systems more accessible to smaller businesses and organizations. Third, the API model allows us to more easily respond to misuse of the technology. Since it is hard to predict the downstream use cases of our models, it feels inherently safer to release them via an API and broaden access over time, rather than release an
open source
model where access cannot be adjusted if it turns out to have harmful applications.

OpenAI has a message for anyone who thinks they’re about to cash in on the AI boom by buying a new “OpenAI token” on Robinhood: Don’t. But in a chaotic turn, Elon Musk just suggested that even the company’s real equity might be an illusion.
The maker of ChatGPT, in a rare public warning posted on X (formerly Twitter), disavowed any involvement with crypto-like financial products claiming to offer a piece of its business.
“These ‘OpenAI tokens’ are not OpenAI equity,” the company wrote. “We did not partner with Robinhood, were not involved in this, and do not endorse it. Any transfer of OpenAI equity requires our approval—we did not approve any transfer.”
The company added a clear warning: “Please be careful.”

This strange situation immediately attracted the attention of Elon Musk, OpenAI’s co-founder turned chief antagonist. He responded to the company’s post with a blunt, explosive accusation of his own:
“Your ‘equity’ is fake.”
Your “equity” is fake

July 2, 2025
The Tokenization of Hype
The controversy began after Robinhood, the popular trading platform,
unveiled a new product
for its European customers. In a statement to Gizmodo, the company explained its move.
“To cap off our recent crypto event, we announced a limited stock token giveaway on OpenAI and SpaceX to eligible European customers,” a Robinhood spokesperson said. ”These tokens give retail investors indirect exposure to private markets, opening up access, and are enabled by Robinhood’s ownership stake in a special purpose vehicle.”
Robinhood used a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), which is essentially a separate company created to hold an investment, to buy a stake in OpenAI. It then issued its own digital tokens that represent a claim on that stake. This process, known as tokenization, aims to make illiquid assets, like a share in a private company, easy to trade.
CEO Vlad Tenev elaborated on X, admitting the tokens are not a direct investment. “While it is true that they aren’t technically ‘equity’ (you can see the precise dynamics in our Terms for those interested), the tokens effectively give retail investors exposure to these private assets,” he explained. “Our giveaway plants a seed for something much bigger.”

Musk vs. OpenAI: The Ownership Wars Continue
Musk’s swipe is the latest in his long running war with the company he helped found and now openly despises. He has accused it of abandoning its nonprofit mission for profit and has even filed a lawsuit against it. But his comment also throws a spotlight on the bizarre corporate structure that makes this whole situation possible.
OpenAI is technically governed by a nonprofit board. Most of its commercial products, like ChatGPT, are operated by a “capped-profit” subsidiary. This hybrid model means investors can earn returns, but only up to a certain limit, after which any excess profits are supposed to be returned to the nonprofit to “benefit humanity.”
This structure makes a traditional IPO impossible and means even internal investors don’t hold “equity” in the normal sense. They own a right to a share of future profits, but only within the complex limits set by the board. So when Musk says “your equity is fake,” he’s not just trolling. He’s pointing out that the very nature of ownership at the world’s most important AI company is confusing and opaque.
Our Take: A Messy Glimpse into the Future
This confluence of crypto hype, corporate vagueness, and a billionaire feud is a dangerous cocktail for everyday investors. AI is the next frontier for financial speculation, and this episode shows how creative the attempts to cash in have become.
Whether Robinhood’s token was a well-intentioned but misleading product or something more cynical, the fact that OpenAI had to publicly disavow it is a massive red flag. You can’t buy OpenAI stock. You can’t trade official OpenAI tokens. If you think you’ve found a way to own a piece of the AI revolution, you’re probably being misled. If someone tells you otherwise, you’re probably being scammed.
But Elon Musk’s jab points to a deeper irony: In the strange, confusing world of OpenAI’s corporate structure, even its own insiders may not really own what they think they do. As the AI gold rush heats up, ownership is becoming one of the most contested, confusing, and misleading parts of the story. And unless companies like OpenAI become more transparent, the vacuum will be filled by fake products, crypto stunts, and viral misinformation.

  title: BBC Threatens to Sue Perplexity, Alleging 'Verbatim' Reproduction of Its Content
  content: The
BBC is threatening to sue AI search engine Perplexity
for unauthorized use of its content, alleging the
artificial intelligence
company reproduced BBC material "verbatim."
In a letter to Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas, as published by
The Financial Times
on Friday, the UK broadcaster and publisher alleges that Perplexity's default AI model was "trained using BBC content." The BBC said it would seek an injunction unless Perplexity stopped scraping BBC content, deleted all BBC material and submitted a "a proposal for financial compensation."
The BBC declined to comment but said reporting by the FT was accurate.
In a statement to the FT, Perplexity said the BBC's claims are "manipulative and opportunistic" and that the broadcasting giant fundamentally doesn't understand how the technology, internet or IP law work. Perplexity also alleged that the threat of litigation shows "how far the BBC is willing to go to preserve Google's illegal monopoly for its own self-interest."
A US judge ruled last year that
Google violated antitrust law
to bolster its search dominance.
Since
Perplexity is an online search engine
built on top of a
large language model
, it can answer pretty much any question asked. This means that it needs good quality information to give users satisfying answers. The BBC alleges that since Perplexity generates answers built on BBC content, that lessens the need for readers to go to the BBC directly.
There's also concern that AI companies aren't using its journalism correctly and impartially, which could damage its reputation. The BBC alleges that 17% of Perplexity search responses had major issues, and "the most common problems were factual inaccuracies, sourcing and missing context."
Perplexity didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
While this is the first time the BBC has gone after an AI company, it isn't the first time Perplexity has run into issues with publishers. Outlets currently suing or threatening to sue Perplexity for copyright infringement include
The Wall Street Journal
along with the New York Post,
Forbes
and
The New York Times
. An investigation by
Wired
last year alleged that Perplexity found ways to get around blocks and scrape its content.
In the midst of these complaints,
Perplexity launched a revenue-sharing program with publishers
last year, which includes Fortune, Time, The Texas Tribune and Der Spiegel.
Publishers are becoming highly defensive of their content, with AI companies seeing valuations soar on the backdrop of increasingly narrow margins in media. OpenAI, the creator of
ChatGPT
, currently has a valuation of $300 billion and
Perplexity's valuation has also soared to $14 billion
. Perplexity
investors
include SoftBank, Nvidia, and Amazon and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos.
At the same time, journalism has struggled in the online age, with
ad dollars being siphoned
off by Google and attention shifting towards
social media apps
. Since 2005, 2,900 local newspapers have closed in the US, according to a study from
Northwestern University
.
(Disclosure: Ziff Davis, CNET's parent company, in April filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.)

  title: ChatGPT: Everything you need to know about the AI chatbot
  content: ChatGPT, OpenAI’s text-generating AI chatbot, has taken the world by storm since its launch
in November 2022.
What started as a tool to supercharge productivity through writing essays and code with
short text prompts
has evolved into a behemoth with
300 million weekly active users.
2024 was a big year for OpenAI, from its
partnership with Apple
for its generative AI offering,
Apple Intelligence,
the release of
GPT-4o with voice capabilities,
and the highly-anticipated launch of its
text-to-video model Sora.
OpenAI also faced its share of internal drama, including the notable exits of high-level execs like co-founder and
longtime chief scientist Ilya Sutskever
and
CTO Mira Murati.
OpenAI has also been hit with lawsuits from
Alden Global Capital-owned newspapers
alleging copyright infringement, as well as
an injunction from Elon Musk
to halt OpenAI’s transition to a for-profit.
In 2025, OpenAI is battling the perception that it’s ceding ground in the AI race to
Chinese rivals like DeepSeek
. The company has been trying to shore up its
relationship with Washington
as it simultaneously
pursues an ambitious data center project,
and as it
reportedly lays the groundwork
for one of the largest funding rounds in history.

OpenAI uses Google’s AI chips to power its products
OpenAI has started using
Google’s AI chips to power ChatGPT
and other products, as reported by Reuters. The ChatGPT maker is one of the biggest buyers of Nvidia’s GPUs, using the AI chips to train models, and this is the first time that OpenAI is using
non
-Nvidia chips in an important way.
A new MIT study suggests that ChatGPT might be harming critical thinking skills
Researchers from MIT’s Media Lab monitored
the brain activity of writers in 32 regions. They found that ChatGPT users showed minimal brain engagement and consistently fell short in neural, linguistic, and behavioral aspects. To conduct the test, the lab split 54 participants from the Boston area into three groups, each consisting of individuals ages 18 to 39. The participants were asked to write multiple SAT essays using tools such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, the Google search engine, or without any tools.
ChatGPT was downloaded 30 million times last month
The ChatGPT app for iOS was downloaded 29.6 million times in the last 28 days, while TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, and X were downloaded a total of 32.9 million times during the same period, representing a difference of about 10.6%, according to
ZDNET report
citing Similarweb’s X post.

OpenAI promises to make changes to prevent future ChatGPT sycophancy
OpenAI
has announced
its plan to
make changes to its procedures for updating the AI models
that power ChatGPT,
following an update
that caused the platform to become
overly sycophantic
for many users.
April 2025
OpenAI clarifies the reason ChatGPT became overly flattering and agreeable
OpenAI
has released a post
on the recent sycophancy issues with the default AI model powering ChatGPT, GPT-4o, leading the company to revert an update to the model released last week. CEO Sam Altman acknowledged the issue on Sunday and confirmed two days later that the
GPT-4o update was being rolled back
. OpenAI is working on “additional fixes” to the model’s personality. Over the weekend, users on social media criticized the new model for making ChatGPT too validating and agreeable. It became a popular meme fast.
OpenAI is working to fix a “bug” that let minors engage in inappropriate conversations
An issue within OpenAI’s ChatGPT enabled the chatbot to create graphic erotic content for accounts registered by users under the age of 18, as demonstrated by
TechCrunch’s testing
, a fact later confirmed by OpenAI. “Protecting younger users is a top priority, and our Model Spec, which guides model behavior, clearly restricts sensitive content like erotica to narrow contexts such as scientific, historical, or news reporting,” a spokesperson told TechCrunch via email. “In this case, a bug allowed responses outside those guidelines, and we are actively deploying a fix to limit these generations.”
ChatGPT helps users by giving recommendations, showing images, and reviewing products for online shopping
OpenAI
has added a few features to
its
ChatGPT search
, its web search tool in ChatGPT, to give users an improved online shopping experience. The company says people can ask super-specific questions using natural language and receive customized results. The chatbot provides recommendations, images, and reviews of products in various categories such as fashion, beauty, home goods, and electronics.
OpenAI wants its AI model to access cloud models for assistance
OpenAI leaders have been talking about allowing the open model to link up with OpenAI’s cloud-hosted models to improve its ability to respond to intricate questions,
two sources familiar with the situation told TechCrunch
.

OpenAI’s GPT-4.1 may be less aligned than earlier models
OpenAI released a new AI model called GPT-4.1 in mid-April. However, multiple independent tests indicate that the model is less reliable than previous OpenAI releases. The company
skipped that step
— sending safety cards for GPT-4.1 — claiming in a statement to TechCrunch that “GPT-4.1 is not a frontier model, so there won’t be a separate system card released for it.”
OpenAI’s o3 AI model scored lower than expected on a benchmark
Questions have been raised regarding OpenAI’s transparency and procedures for testing models after a
difference in benchmark outcomes
was detected by first- and third-party benchmark results for the o3 AI model. OpenAI introduced o3 in December, stating that the model could solve approximately 25% of questions on FrontierMath, a difficult math problem set. Epoch AI, the research institute behind FrontierMath, discovered that o3 achieved a score of approximately 10%, which was significantly lower than OpenAI’s top-reported score.
OpenAI unveils Flex processing for cheaper, slower AI tasks
OpenAI has launched
a new API feature called Flex processing
that allows users to use AI models at a lower cost but with slower response times and occasional resource unavailability. Flex processing is available in beta on the o3 and o4-mini reasoning models for non-production tasks like model evaluations, data enrichment, and asynchronous workloads.
OpenAI’s latest AI models now have a safeguard against biorisks
OpenAI has rolled out a new system to monitor its
AI reasoning models, o3 and o4 mini
, for biological and chemical threats. The system is designed to prevent models from giving advice that could potentially lead to harmful attacks, as stated in
OpenAI’s safety report
.
OpenAI launches its latest reasoning models, o3 and o4-mini
OpenAI
has released two new reasoning models
, o3 and o4 mini, just two days after launching GPT-4.1. The company claims o3 is the most advanced reasoning model it has developed, while o4-mini is said to provide a balance of price, speed, and performance. The new models stand out from previous reasoning models because they can use ChatGPT features like web browsing, coding, and image processing and generation. But
they hallucinate
more than several of OpenAI’s previous models.
OpenAI has added a new section to ChatGPT to offer easier access to AI-generated images for all user tiers
Open AI introduced a new section called “library” to make it easier for users to create images on mobile and web platforms, per

OpenAI plans to release a new ‘open’ AI language model
OpeanAI
intends to release its “first” open language model
since
GPT-2
“in the coming months.” The company plans to host developer events to gather feedback and eventually showcase prototypes of the model. The first developer event is to be held in San Francisco, with sessions to follow in Europe and Asia.
OpenAI removes ChatGPT’s restrictions on image generation
OpenAI
made a notable change to its content moderation policies
after the success of its new image generator in ChatGPT, which went viral for being able to create
Studio Ghibli-style images
. The company has updated its policies to allow ChatGPT to generate images of public figures, hateful symbols, and racial features when requested. OpenAI had previously declined such prompts due to the potential controversy or harm they may cause. However, the company has now “evolved” its approach, as stated
in a blog post
published by Joanne Jang, the lead for OpenAI’s model behavior.
OpenAI adopts Anthropic’s standard for linking AI models with data
OpenAI
wants to incorporate Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP)
into all of its products, including the ChatGPT desktop app. MCP, an open-source standard, helps AI models generate more accurate and suitable responses to specific queries, and lets developers create bidirectional links between data sources and AI applications like chatbots. The protocol is currently available in the Agents SDK, and support for the ChatGPT desktop app and Responses API will be coming soon, OpenAI CEO
Sam Altman said
.
OpenAI’s viral Studio Ghibli-style images could raise AI copyright concerns
The latest update of the image generator on OpenAI’s ChatGPT
has triggered a flood of AI-generated memes in the style of Studio Ghibli, the Japanese animation studio behind blockbuster films like “My Neighbor Totoro” and “Spirited Away.” The burgeoning mass of Ghibli-esque images have
sparked concerns about
whether OpenAI has violated copyright laws, especially since the company is already facing legal action for using source material without authorization.

Meta also plans to bolster its presence in India by constructing a large 3GW data center in Jamnagar, Gujarat. OpenAI, Meta, and Reliance have not yet officially announced these plans.
OpenAI faces privacy complaint in Europe for chatbot’s defamatory hallucinations
Noyb, a privacy rights advocacy group, is supporting an individual in Norway
who was shocked to discover that ChatGPT
was providing false information about him, stating that he had been found guilty of killing two of his children and trying to harm the third. “The GDPR is clear. Personal data has to be accurate,” said Joakim Söderberg, data protection lawyer at Noyb, in a statement. “If it’s not, users have the right to have it changed to reflect the truth. Showing ChatGPT users a tiny disclaimer that the chatbot can make mistakes clearly isn’t enough. You can’t just spread false information and in the end add a small disclaimer saying that everything you said may just not be true.”
OpenAI upgrades its transcription and voice-generating AI models
OpenAI
has added new transcription and voice-generating AI models to its APIs
: a text-to-speech model, “gpt-4o-mini-tts,” that delivers more nuanced and realistic sounding speech, as well as two speech-to-text models called “gpt-4o-transcribe” and “gpt-4o-mini-transcribe”. The company claims they are improved versions of what was already there and that they hallucinate less.
OpenAI has launched o1-pro, a more powerful version of its o1
OpenAI
has introduced o1-pro
in its developer API. OpenAI says its o1-pro uses more computing than its
o1 “reasoning” AI model
to deliver “consistently better responses.” It’s only accessible to select developers who have spent at least $5 on OpenAI API services. OpenAI charges $150 for every million tokens (about 750,000 words) input into the model and $600 for every million tokens the model produces. It costs twice as much as
OpenAI’s GPT-4.5
for input and 10 times the price of regular o1.
OpenAI research lead Noam Brown thinks AI “reasoning” models could’ve arrived decades ago
Noam Brown, who heads AI reasoning research at OpenAI,
thinks that certain types of AI models for “reasoning” could have been developed 20 years ago
if researchers had understood the correct approach and algorithms.
OpenAI says it has trained an AI that’s “really good” at creative writing
OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, in a
post on X
, that the company has
trained a “new model” that’s “really good” at creative writing
. He posted a lengthy sample from the model given the prompt “Please write a metafictional literary short story about AI and grief.” OpenAI has not extensively explored the use of AI for writing fiction. The company has mostly concentrated on challenges in rigid, predictable areas such as math and programming.
And it turns out that it
might not be that great
at creative writing at all.
we trained a new model that is good at creative writing (not sure yet how/when it will get released). this is the first time i have been really struck by something written by AI; it got the vibe of metafiction so right.
PROMPT:
Please write a metafictional literary short story…

OpenAI launches new tools to help businesses build AI agents
OpenAI
rolled out new tools
designed
to help developers and businesses build AI agents
— automated systems that can independently accomplish tasks — using the company’s own AI models and frameworks. The tools are part of OpenAI’s new Responses API, which enables enterprises to develop customized AI agents that can perform web searches, scan through company files, and navigate websites, similar to
OpenAI’s Operator product
. The Responses API effectively replaces
OpenAI’s Assistants API
, which the company plans to discontinue in the first half of 2026.
OpenAI reportedly plans to charge up to $20,000 a month for specialized AI ‘agents’
OpenAI
intends to release several “agent” products
tailored for different applications, including sorting and ranking sales leads and software engineering, according to
a report from The Information
. One, a “high-income knowledge worker” agent, will reportedly be priced at $2,000 a month. Another, a software developer agent, is said to cost $10,000 a month. The most expensive rumored agents, which are said to be aimed at supporting “PhD-level research,” are expected to cost $20,000 per month. The jaw-dropping figure is indicative of how much cash OpenAI needs right now: The company lost roughly $5 billion last year after paying for costs related to running its services and other expenses. It’s unclear when these agentic tools might launch or which customers will be eligible to buy them.
ChatGPT can directly edit your code
The latest version of the macOS ChatGPT app
allows users to edit code directly in supported developer tools
, including Xcode, VS Code, and JetBrains. ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team subscribers can use the feature now, and the company plans to roll it out to more users like Enterprise, Edu, and free users.
ChatGPT’s weekly active users doubled in less than 6 months, thanks to new releases
According to
a new report
from VC firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), OpenAI’s AI chatbot, ChatGPT,
experienced solid growth in the second half of 2024.
It took ChatGPT nine months to increase its weekly active users from
100 million in November 2023
to 200 million in August 2024, but it only took less than six months to double that number once more, according to the report. ChatGPT’s weekly active users increased to
300 million by December 2024
and
400 million by February 2025
. ChatGPT has experienced significant growth recently due to the launch of new models and features, such as GPT-4o, with multimodal capabilities. ChatGPT usage spiked from April to May 2024, shortly after that model’s launch.
February 2025
OpenAI cancels its o3 AI model in favor of a ‘unified’ next-gen release
OpenAI has effectively canceled the release of o3 in favor of what CEO Sam Altman is calling a “simplified” product offering. In a
post on X
, Altman said that, in the coming months, OpenAI will release a model called GPT-5 that “integrates a lot of [OpenAI’s] technology,” including o3, in ChatGPT and its API. As a result of that roadmap decision, OpenAI no longer plans to release o3 as a standalone model.
ChatGPT may not be as power-hungry as once assumed
A
commonly cited stat
is that ChatGPT requires around 3 watt-hours of power to answer a single question. Using OpenAI’s latest default model for ChatGPT, GPT-4o, as a reference, nonprofit
AI research institute Epoch AI
found the average ChatGPT query
consumes around 0.3 watt-hours.
However, the analysis doesn’t consider the additional energy costs incurred by ChatGPT with features like image generation or input processing.
OpenAI now reveals more of its o3-mini model’s thought process
In response to pressure from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI is changing the way its o3-mini model communicates
its step-by-step “thought” process.
ChatGPT users will see an updated “chain of thought” that shows more of the model’s “reasoning” steps and how it arrived at answers to questions.
You can now use ChatGPT web search without logging in
OpenAI is now allowing anyone to use ChatGPT web search
without having to log in.
While OpenAI
had previously allowed
users to ask ChatGPT questions without signing in, responses were restricted to the chatbot’s last training update. This only applies through ChatGPT.com, however. To use ChatGPT in any form through the native mobile app, you will still need to be logged in.
OpenAI unveils a new ChatGPT agent for ‘deep research’
OpenAI announced a new AI “agent”
called deep research
that’s designed to help people conduct in-depth, complex research using ChatGPT. OpenAI says the “agent” is intended for instances where you don’t just want a quick answer or summary, but instead need to assiduously consider information from multiple websites and other sources.
January 2025
OpenAI used a subreddit to test AI persuasion
OpenAI used the subreddit r/ChangeMyView to
measure the persuasive abilities
of its AI reasoning models. OpenAI says it collects user
posts from the subreddit
and asks its AI models to write replies, in a closed environment, that would change the Reddit user’s mind on a subject. The company then shows the responses to testers, who assess how persuasive the argument is, and finally OpenAI compares the AI models’ responses to human replies for that same post.
OpenAI launches o3-mini, its latest ‘reasoning’ model
OpenAI launched a new
AI “reasoning” model, o3-mini,
the newest in the company’s o family of models. OpenAI first
previewed the model in December
alongside a more capable system called o3. OpenAI is pitching its new model as both “powerful” and “affordable.”
ChatGPT’s mobile users are 85% male, report says
A new report from app analytics firm Appfigures found that
over half of ChatGPT’s mobile users
are under age 25, with users between ages 50 and 64 making up the second largest age demographic. The gender gap among ChatGPT users is even more significant. Appfigures estimates that across age groups, men make up 84.5% of all users.
OpenAI launches ChatGPT plan for US government agencies
OpenAI launched ChatGPT Gov
designed to provide U.S. government agencies
an additional way to access the tech. ChatGPT Gov includes many of the capabilities found in OpenAI’s corporate-focused tier, ChatGPT Enterprise. OpenAI says that ChatGPT Gov enables agencies to more easily manage their own security, privacy, and compliance, and could expedite internal authorization of OpenAI’s tools for the handling of non-public sensitive data.
More teens report using ChatGPT for schoolwork, despite the tech’s faults
Younger Gen Zers are embracing ChatGPT, for schoolwork,
according to a new survey by the Pew Research Center.
In a follow-up to its 2023 poll on ChatGPT usage among young people, Pew asked ~1,400 U.S.-based teens ages 13 to 17 whether they’ve used ChatGPT for homework or other school-related assignments. Twenty-six percent said that they had, double the number two years ago. Just over half of teens responding to the poll said they think it’s acceptable to use ChatGPT for researching new subjects. But considering the ways ChatGPT can fall short, the results are possibly cause for alarm.
OpenAI says it may store deleted Operator data for up to 90 days
OpenAI says that it might store chats and associated screenshots from customers who use Operator,
the company’s AI “agent” tool,
for up to 90 days — even after a user manually deletes them. While OpenAI has a similar deleted data retention policy for ChatGPT, the retention period for ChatGPT is only 30 days,
which is 60 days shorter than Operator’s.
OpenAI launches Operator, an AI agent that performs tasks autonomously
OpenAI is launching a research preview of Operator, a general-purpose AI agent that can
take control of a web browser and independently perform certain actions.
Operator promises to automate tasks such as booking travel accommodations, making restaurant reservations, and shopping online.
OpenAI may preview its agent tool for users on the $200-per-month Pro plan
Operator,
OpenAI’s agent tool,
could be released sooner rather than later. Changes to ChatGPT’s code base suggest that
Operator will be available as an early research preview
to users on the $200 Pro subscription plan. The changes aren’t yet publicly visible, but
a user on X who goes by Choi
spotted these updates in ChatGPT’s client-side code. TechCrunch separately identified the same references to Operator on OpenAI’s website.
OpenAI tests phone number-only ChatGPT signups
OpenAI has begun testing a feature that lets new ChatGPT users
sign up with only a phone number
— no email required. The feature is currently in beta in the U.S. and India. However, users who create an account using their number can’t upgrade to one of OpenAI’s paid plans without verifying their account via an email. Multi-factor authentication also isn’t supported without a valid email.
ChatGPT now lets you schedule reminders and recurring tasks
ChatGPT’s new beta feature, called tasks,
allows users to set simple reminders
. For example, you can ask ChatGPT to remind you when your passport expires in six months, and the AI assistant will follow up with a push notification on whatever platform you have tasks enabled. The feature will start rolling out to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro users around the globe this week.
New ChatGPT feature lets users assign it traits like ‘chatty’ and ‘Gen Z’
OpenAI is introducing a new way for users to
customize their interactions with ChatGPT.
Some users found they can specify a preferred name or nickname and “traits” they’d like the chatbot to have. OpenAI suggests traits like “Chatty,” “Encouraging,” and “Gen Z.” However,
some users reported
that the new options have disappeared, so it’s possible they went live prematurely.

Anyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies and
search engines
are utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns.
What companies use ChatGPT?
Multiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others may
limit the use of the AI-powered tool
.
Most recently,
Microsoft announced
at its 2023 Build conference that it is integrating its ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup
Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT
to produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT.  And nonprofit organization
Solana officially integrated the chatbot
into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space.
What does GPT mean in ChatGPT?
GPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.
What is the difference between ChatGPT and a chatbot?
A chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn’t necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they’ll give canned responses to questions.
ChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt.
Can ChatGPT write essays?
Yes.
Can ChatGPT commit libel?
Due to the nature of how these models work
, they don’t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That’s a problem when you’re using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn’t commit, that may well at this point be libel.
We will see how
handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT
will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry.
Does ChatGPT have an app?
Yes,
there is a free ChatGPT mobile app
for iOS and Android users.
What is the ChatGPT character limit?
It’s not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words.

Everyday examples include programming, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc.
What are some advanced uses for ChatGPT?
Advanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.
How good is ChatGPT at writing code?
It depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can’t necessarily program an entire app’s worth of code. That’s because ChatGPT lacks context awareness — in other words, the generated code isn’t always appropriate for the specific context in which it’s being used.
Can you save a ChatGPT chat?
Yes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.
Are there alternatives to ChatGPT?
Yes. There are
multiple AI-powered chatbot
competitors such as
Together
, Google’s
Gemini
and Anthropic’s
Claude
, and developers are
creating open source
alternatives
.
How does ChatGPT handle data privacy?
OpenAI has said that individuals in “certain jurisdictions” (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out
this form
. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression “in accordance with applicable laws”.
The web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled “
OpenAI Personal Data Removal Request
”.
In its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on “legitimate interest” (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out — when it writes: “See
here
for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.”
What controversies have surrounded ChatGPT?
Recently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI’s technology into its bot named Clyde where
two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine

due to ChatGPT’s false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.
CNET found itself in the midst of controversy after
Futurism reported
the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was
accused
of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.
Several major school systems and colleges,
including New York City Public Schools
, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that
not every educator agrees with
.
There have also been cases of ChatGPT
accusing individuals of false crimes
.
Where can I find examples of ChatGPT prompts?
Several marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One is
PromptBase
. Another is
ChatX
. More launch every day.
Can ChatGPT be detected?
Poorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in our
tests
, they’re inconsistent at best.
Are ChatGPT chats public?
No. But OpenAI
recently
disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users’ conversations to other people on the service.
What lawsuits are there surrounding ChatGPT?
None specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is
involved
in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT.
Are there issues regarding plagiarism with ChatGPT?
Yes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data.

Anthropic
CEO Dario Amodei made an
urgent push
in April for the need to understand how AI models think.
This comes at a crucial time. As Anthropic
battles
in global AI rankings, it’s important to note what sets it apart from other top AI labs. Since its founding in 2021, when seven
OpenAI
employees
broke off
over concerns about AI safety, Anthropic has built AI models that adhere to a set of human-valued principles, a system they call
Constitutional AI
. These principles ensure that models are “
helpful, honest and harmless
” and generally act in the best interests of society. At the same time, Anthropic’s research arm is
diving deep
to understand how its models think about the world, and
why
they produce helpful (and sometimes harmful) answers.
Anthropic’s flagship model, Claude 3.7 Sonnet,
dominated
coding benchmarks when it launched in February, proving that AI models can excel at both performance and safety. And the recent release of Claude 4.0 Opus and Sonnet again puts Claude at the
top of coding benchmarks
. However, in today’s rapid and hyper-competitive AI market, Anthropic’s rivals like Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro and Open AI’s o3 have their own impressive showings for coding prowess, while they’re
already dominating
Claude at math, creative writing and overall reasoning across many languages.
If Amodei’s thoughts are any indication, Anthropic is planning for the future of AI and its implications in critical fields like medicine, psychology and law, where model safety and human values are imperative. And it shows: Anthropic is the leading AI lab that focuses strictly on developing “interpretable” AI, which are models that let us understand, to some degree of certainty, what the model is thinking and how it arrives at a particular conclusion.
Amazon and
Google
have already invested billions of dollars in Anthropic even as they build their own AI models, so perhaps Anthropic’s competitive advantage is still budding. Interpretable models, as Anthropic suggests, could significantly reduce the long-term operational costs associated with debugging, auditing and mitigating risks in complex AI deployments.
Sayash Kapoor
, an AI safety researcher, suggests that while interpretability is valuable, it is just one of many tools for managing AI risk. In his view, “interpretability is neither necessary nor sufficient” to ensure models behave safely — it matters most when paired with filters, verifiers and human-centered design. This more expansive view sees interpretability as part of a larger ecosystem of control strategies, particularly in real-world AI deployments where models are components in broader decision-making systems.
The need for interpretable AI
Until recently, many thought AI was still years from advancements like those that are now helping Claude, Gemini and ChatGPT
boast
exceptional market adoption. While these models are already
pushing the frontiers of human knowledge
, their widespread use is attributable to just how good they are at solving a wide range of practical problems that require creative problem-solving or detailed analysis. As models are put to the task on increasingly critical problems, it is important that they produce accurate answers.
Amodei fears that when an AI responds to a prompt, “we have no idea… why it chooses certain words over others, or why it occasionally makes a mistake despite usually being accurate.” Such errors — hallucinations of inaccurate information, or responses that do not align with human values — will hold AI models back from reaching their full potential. Indeed, we’ve seen many examples of AI continuing to struggle with
hallucinations
and
unethical behavior
.
For Amodei, the best way to solve these problems is to understand how an AI thinks: “Our inability to understand models’ internal mechanisms means that we cannot meaningfully predict such [harmful] behaviors, and therefore struggle to rule them out … If instead it were possible to look inside models, we might be able to systematically block all jailbreaks, and also characterize what dangerous knowledge the models have.”
Amodei also sees the opacity of current models as a barrier to deploying AI models in “high-stakes financial or safety-critical settings, because we can’t fully set the limits on their behavior, and a small number of mistakes could be very harmful.” In decision-making that affects humans directly, like medical diagnosis or mortgage assessments, legal
regulations
require AI to explain its decisions.
Imagine a financial institution using a large language model (LLM) for fraud detection — interpretability could mean explaining a denied loan application to a customer as required by law. Or a manufacturing firm optimizing supply chains — understanding why an AI suggests a particular supplier could unlock efficiencies and prevent unforeseen bottlenecks.
Because of this, Amodei explains, “Anthropic is doubling down on interpretability, and we have a goal of getting to ‘interpretability can reliably detect most model problems’ by 2027.”
To that end, Anthropic recently participated in a $50 million
investment
in
Goodfire
, an AI research lab making breakthrough progress on AI “brain scans.” Their model inspection platform, Ember, is an agnostic tool that identifies learned concepts within models and lets users manipulate them. In a recent
demo
, the company showed how Ember can recognize individual visual concepts within an image generation AI and then let users
paint
these concepts on a canvas to generate new images that follow the user’s design.
Anthropic’s investment in Ember hints at the fact that developing interpretable models is difficult enough that Anthropic does not have the manpower to achieve interpretability on their own. Creative interpretable models requires new toolchains and skilled developers to build them
Broader context: An AI researcher’s perspective
To break down Amodei’s perspective and add much-needed context, VentureBeat interviewed Kapoor an AI safety researcher at Princeton. Kapoor co-authored the book
AI Snake Oil
, a critical examination of exaggerated claims surrounding the capabilities of leading AI models. He is also a co-author of “
AI as Normal Technology
,” in which he advocates for treating AI as a standard, transformational tool like the internet or electricity, and promotes a realistic perspective on its integration into everyday systems.
Kapoor doesn’t dispute that interpretability is valuable. However, he’s skeptical of treating it as the central pillar of AI alignment. “It’s not a silver bullet,” Kapoor told VentureBeat. Many of the most effective safety techniques, such as post-response filtering, don’t require opening up the model at all, he said.
He also warns against what researchers call the “fallacy of inscrutability” — the idea that if we don’t fully understand a system’s internals, we can’t use or regulate it responsibly. In practice, full transparency isn’t how most technologies are evaluated. What matters is whether a system performs reliably under real conditions.
This isn’t the first time Amodei has warned about the risks of AI outpacing our understanding. In his October 2024
post
, “Machines of Loving Grace,” he sketched out a vision of increasingly capable models that could take meaningful real-world actions (and maybe double our lifespans).
According to Kapoor, there’s an important distinction to be made here between a model’s
capability
and its
power
. Model capabilities are undoubtedly increasing rapidly, and they may soon develop enough intelligence to find solutions for many complex problems challenging humanity today. But a model is only as powerful as the interfaces we provide it to interact with the real world, including where and how models are deployed.
Amodei has separately argued that the U.S. should maintain a lead in AI development, in part through
export controls
that limit access to powerful models. The idea is that authoritarian governments might use frontier AI systems irresponsibly — or seize the geopolitical and economic edge that comes with deploying them first.
For Kapoor, “Even the biggest proponents of export controls agree that it will give us at most a year or two.” He thinks we should treat AI as a “
normal technology
” like electricity or the internet. While revolutionary, it took decades for both technologies to be fully realized throughout society. Kapoor thinks it’s the same for AI: The best way to maintain geopolitical edge is to focus on the “long game” of transforming industries to use AI effectively.
Others critiquing Amodei
Kapoor isn’t the only one critiquing Amodei’s stance. Last week at VivaTech in Paris, Jansen Huang, CEO of Nvidia,
declared his disagreement
with Amodei’s views. Huang questioned whether the authority to develop AI should be limited to a few powerful entities like Anthropic. He said: “If you want things to be done safely and responsibly, you do it in the open … Don’t do it in a dark room and tell me it’s safe.”
In response, Anthropic
stated
: “Dario has never claimed that ‘only Anthropic’ can build safe and powerful AI. As the public record will show, Dario has advocated for a national transparency standard for AI developers (including Anthropic) so the public and policymakers are aware of the models’ capabilities and risks and can prepare accordingly.”
It’s also worth noting that Anthropic isn’t alone in its pursuit of interpretability: Google’s DeepMind interpretability team, led by Neel Nanda, has also made
serious contributions
to interpretability research.
Ultimately, top AI labs and researchers are providing strong evidence that interpretability could be a key differentiator in the competitive AI market. Enterprises that prioritize interpretability early may gain a significant competitive edge by building more trusted, compliant, and adaptable AI systems.

  title: California AI Policy Report Warns of ‘Irreversible Harms’
  content: While AI could offer transformative benefits, without proper safeguards it could facilitate nuclear and biological threats and cause “potentially irreversible harms,” a new report commissioned by California Governor Gavin Newsom has warned.
“The opportunity to establish effective AI governance frameworks may not remain open indefinitely,” says the report, which was published on June 17. Citing new evidence that AI can help users source nuclear-grade uranium and is on the cusp of letting novices create biological threats, it notes that the cost for inaction at this current moment could be “extremely high.”

The 53-page document stems from a working group established by Governor Newsom, in a state that has emerged as a central arena for AI legislation. With no comprehensive federal regulation on the horizon, state-level efforts to govern the technology have taken on outsized significance, particularly in California, which is home to many of the world’s top AI companies. In 2023, California Senator Scott Wiener sponsored a
first-of-its-kind bill
, SB 1047, which would have required that large-scale AI developers implement rigorous safety testing and mitigation for their systems, but which critics feared would stifle innovation and squash the open-source AI community. The bill passed both state houses despite fierce industry opposition, but Governor Newsom ultimately vetoed it last September,
deeming
it “well-intentioned” but not the “best approach to protecting the public.”
Following that veto, Newsom launched the working group to “develop workable guardrails for deploying GenAI.” The group was co-led by “godmother of AI”
Fei-Fei Li
, a prominent
opponent
of SB 1047, alongside Mariano-Florentino Cuéllar, president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a member of the National Academy of Sciences Committee on Social and Ethical Implications of Computing Research, and Jennifer Tour Chayes dean of the College of Computing, Data Science, and Society at UC Berkeley. The working group evaluated AI’s progress, SB 1047's weak points, and solicited feedback from more than 60 experts. “As the global epicenter of AI innovation, California is uniquely positioned to lead in unlocking the transformative potential of frontier AI,” Li said in a statement. “Realizing this promise, however, demands thoughtful and responsible stewardship—grounded in human-centered values, scientific rigor, and broad-based collaboration,” she said.

"Foundation model capabilities have rapidly advanced since Governor Newsom vetoed SB 1047 last September," the report states. The industry has shifted from large language AI models that merely predict the next word in a stream of text toward systems trained to solve complex problems and that benefit from "inference scaling," which allows them more time to process information. These advances could accelerate scientific research, but also potentially amplify national security risks by making it easier for bad actors to conduct cyberattacks or acquire chemical and biological weapons. The report points to Anthropic’s Claude 4 models, released just last month, which the company
said
might be capable of helping would-be terrorists create bioweapons or engineer a pandemic. Similarly, OpenAI’s o3 model reportedly outperformed 94% of virologists on a key evaluation.
In recent months, new evidence has emerged showing AI’s ability to
strategically lie
, appearing aligned with its creators’ goals during training but displaying other objectives once deployed, and
exploit loopholes
to achieve its goals, the report says. While “currently benign, these developments represent concrete empirical evidence for behaviors that could present significant challenges to measuring loss of control risks and possibly foreshadow future harm,” the report says.

While Republicans have proposed a 10 year ban on all state AI regulation over concerns that a fragmented policy environment could hamper national competitiveness, the report argues that targeted regulation in California could actually “reduce compliance burdens on developers and avoid a patchwork approach” by providing a blueprint for other states, while keeping the public safer. It stops short of advocating for any specific policy, instead outlining the key principles the working group believes California should adopt when crafting future legislation. It “steers clear” of some of the more divisive provisions of SB 1047, like the requirement for a "kill switch" or shutdown mechanism to quickly halt certain AI systems in case of potential harm, says Scott Singer, a visiting scholar in the Technology and International Affairs Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, and a lead-writer of the report.

Instead, the approach centers around enhancing transparency, for example through legally protecting whistleblowers and establishing incident reporting systems, so that lawmakers and the public have better visibility into AI’s progress. The goal is to “reap the benefits of innovation. Let’s not set artificial barriers, but at the same time, as we go, let's think about what we're learning about how it is that the technology is behaving,” says Cuéllar, who co-led the report. The report emphasizes this visibility is crucial not only for public-facing AI applications, but for understanding how systems are tested and deployed inside AI companies, where concerning behaviors might first emerge.
“The underlying approach here is one of ‘trust but verify,’" Singer says, a concept borrowed from Cold War-era arms control treaties that would involve designing mechanisms to independently check compliance. That’s a departure from existing efforts, which hinge on voluntary cooperation from companies, such as the deal between OpenAI and Center for AI Standards and Innovation (formerly the U.S. AI Safety Institute) to conduct pre-deployment tests. It’s an approach that acknowledges the “substantial expertise inside industry,” Singer says, but “also underscores the importance of methods of independently verifying safety claims.”
