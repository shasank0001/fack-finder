story
Flying to London, a Boeing 787 aircraft operated by Air India "crashed shortly after taking off..."
reports Bloomberg
, "in what stands to be the worst accident involving the U.S. planemaker's most advanced widebody airliner."
Flight AI171 was carrying 242 passengers and crew. Video footage shared on social media showed a giant plume of smoke engulfing the crash site, with no reports of survivors. [UPDATE:   Reuters reports one passenger
jumped out of the emergency exit and survived
, with a senior police officer saying "chances are that there might be more survivors among the injured who are being treated in the hospital."]
The aircraft entered a slow descent shortly after taking off, with its landing gear still extended before exploding into a huge fireball upon impact. The crash took place in a residential area, which could mean a higher death toll...  The pilots in command issued a mayday call immediately after take-off to air traffic controllers, according to India's civil aviation regulator.

Verified video shows the Air India plane descending before deadly crash
An Air India plane travelling from India to London crashed within moments of take-off on Thursday, killing 241 passengers and crew, and more people on the ground.
The Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, which took off from the city of Ahmedabad, in western India, ploughed into a residential area, hitting a hospital complex and medical student hostel.
One passenger survived the disaster - a British national, who was sitting in seat 11A and who later told family he had no idea how he walked away.
It is not yet clear what caused the crash, which Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi described as "heartbreaking beyond words".
Officials warned the death toll could rise in what was quickly described as one of the deadliest aviation disasters in India's history.
Air India Flight AI171 departed Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport at 13:39 local time (08:09 GMT), and was due to touch-down at London's Gatwick Airport at 18:25 BST.
There were 230 passengers on board, including 169 Indian nationals, 53 Britons, seven Portuguese citizens, one Canadian and 12 crew members.
The local police chief told the BBC that 204 bodies had been recovered so far - but it is not known how many of those victims were on the plane or were on the ground.
Images from the scene show debris scattered across a large crash zone, with parts of the aircraft embedded in buildings.

The extraordinary news that one person had survived the disaster quickly made international headlines, as the British national, Vishwashkumar Ramesh, was filmed limping towards an ambulance, with smoke billowing in the background.

What could caused Air India plane to crash in 30 seconds?
"Thirty seconds after take-off, there was a loud noise... it all happened so quickly," he told local media from hospital.
His cousin, Ajay Valgi, said Mr Ramesh called his family to say he was "fine", but he does not know the whereabouts of his brother, also called Ajay, who was on the plane with him.

Thursday's incident was the first fatal crash involving a 787 Dreamliner, first introduced in 2011.
Boeing said in a statement that it "stands ready" to support the investigation, which is being led by India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau.
"We are in contact with Air India regarding Flight 171 and stand ready to support them. Our thoughts are with the passengers, crew, first responders and all affected," the bureau said.
US and British investigators will travel to India, with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) saying it will assist Indian authorities.
India's Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) said the aircraft issued a mayday call seconds after take-off.
It lost contact with air traffic control shortly thereafter, crashing just outside the airport's perimeter.
The crash site lies within a medical campus with 10 specialised centres. The BBC's Sachin Pithva described scenes of chaos, with rescue workers retrieving the remains of those who perished.
Thick smoke was still billowing from the buildings hours after the crash, and passengers' passports were strewn around, he reported.
Gujarat's Additional Chief Secretary for Health confirmed the aircraft struck the students' hostel and staff quarters of Byramjee Jeejeebhoy Medical College and Civil Hospital.

The plane crashed into several buildings in a residential area of Ahmedabad
"It crashed into the hostel mess and then bounced off on to one of the hostel buildings," the hospital's dean, Dr Meenkashi Parekh, told the BBC.
The crash happened at lunchtime when many students were in the canteen, she added. Photos show a huge part of the plane stuck in one of the hostel buildings, and a dusty, deserted mess hall with plates of uneaten food still on the tables.
"Most of the students escaped... but the building caught fire and the smoke was extremely thick. So, 10 to 12 students were trapped," the dean said.
She added it was possible that several students had been killed. Officials said dozens were in hospital.

Tata Group, which owns Air India, has said it would give one crore rupee - the equivalent of about £86,000 - to the families of each person who was killed in the crash.
Prime Minister Modi wrote on X: "The tragedy in Ahmedabad has stunned and saddened us. It is heartbreaking beyond words. In this sad hour, my thoughts are with everyone affected by it."
Both Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said they are being kept updated as the situation develops, while King Charles expressed his "deepest sympathies" to all those affected by the crash.
Starmer confirmed that a UK team had been dispatched to Gujarat to join the investigation as he urged families and friends of anyone affected to contact the Foreign Office.

AHMEDABAD/ NEW DELHI
-
India’s government is urgently inspecting all Boeing 787s after
a devastating Air India crash that claimed at least 270 lives this week,
the Aviation Minister said on June 14, adding that the authorities were investigating all possible causes.
The aviation regulator on June 13 ordered Air India to conduct additional maintenance checks on its Boeing 787-8 and 787-9 aircraft equipped with GEnx engines, including assessments of certain take-off parameters, electronic engine control tests and engine fuel-related checks.
“We have also given the order to do extended surveillance of the 787 planes. There are 34 in our Indian fleet,” Aviation Minister Ram Mohan Naidu told a media briefing in New Delhi.
“Eight have already been inspected, and with immediate urgency all of them are going to be done.”
Air India operates 33 Boeing 787s, while rival airline IndiGo has one, according to data from Flightradar24.
The planes, however, have not been grounded, but a source on June 13 told Reuters the Indian government was considering that as an option.
Mr Naidu also said that the government will look at all possible theories of what had led to the crash.
Reuters has reported that Air India and the Indian government were looking at several aspects of the crash, including issues linked to its engine thrust, flaps, and why the landing gear remained open as the plane took off and then came down.
The Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner with 242 people on board bound for Britain’s Gatwick Airport began losing height seconds after take-off on June 12 and erupted in a fireball as it hit buildings below, in what is the world’s worst aviation disaster in a decade.
A police source told AFP on June 14 that 279 bodies had been found at the crash site.
Only one of the 242 passengers and crew on board survived, while others were killed as the plane struck a medical college’s hostel as it came down.
The crisis has cast a shadow on Air India, which has struggled for years to rebuild its reputation and revamp its fleet after the Tata Group took over the airline from the Indian government in 2022.
Tata’s chairman said on June 13 the group wants to understand what happened, but “we don’t know right now”.
Mr Naidu said a government panel was investigating the crash and will issue a report within three months.
“We are going to improve every necessary thing that is going to come our way, to improve safety,” the minister said at the briefing, declining questions from journalists.
Long wait for families
Dozens of anxious family members have been waiting outside an Ahmedabad hospital to collect the bodies of their loved ones killed in the crash, as doctors work overtime to gather dental samples from the dead to run identification checks and DNA profiling.
Mr Rafiq Abdul Hafiz Memon, who lost four relatives in the incident, said he was not getting any answers from the authorities and was “very hassled”.
“We have lost our children... We are not understanding anything. Please help us get information about our children. Tell us when they are going to release their bodies,” he said.
Another father was upset about not being able to get the body of his son, Mr Harshad Patel, saying he was told by the authorities that it will take 72 hours for DNA profiling.
“The authorities are trying to help, but our patience is running out,” he said.
Most of the bodies in the crash were badly charred and the authorities are using dental samples to run identification checks.
Dr Jaishankar Pillai, a forensic dentist, told reporters on June 13 they had the dental records of 135 charred victims, which can then be matched through reference to victims’ prior dental charts, radiographs or other records.
Things are getting hard even for doctors, as the plane struck a hostel building of the Byramjee Jeejeebhoy Medical College, where many of the dead are also undergoing identification checks.
“Most of us are struggling with our emotions and are mentally disturbed because of the loss of friends and colleagues,” said one doctor who did not wish to be named.
“The loss of so many colleagues and friends in this incident is difficult.”

All 329 people on board were killed including 268 Canadian citizens, 27 British citizens, and 22 Indian citizens.

The bombing of Air India Flight 182 is the worst terrorist attack in Canadian history and was the world's deadliest act of aviation terrorism until the
September 11 attacks
in 2001. It remains the deadliest aviation incident in the history of Air India.

The masterminds behind the bombing are believed to be Inderjit Singh Reyat, a dual British-Canadian national, who pleaded guilty in 2003,

and
Talwinder Singh Parmar
,
separatist
leader, who was one of the key individuals associated with the extremist group

The plot included a second bomb, intended to commit mass murder of the occupants of
Air India Flight 301
, but instead killed two baggage handlers at Tokyo's
Narita International Airport
when the bomb suitcase was being transferred from the original Canadian airplane to the Air India 747; fragments from this bomb proved Reyat's involvement. The two bombs had started their journey when checked onto a pair of
Canadian Pacific Air Lines
flights from
Vancouver International Airport
, one headed to Tokyo – for connection with Air India Flight 301, and one to Montreal – for connection with Air India Flight 182.
The plan's execution had transnational consequences and involved citizens and governments from five nation states. Babbar Khalsa, a
Khalistani
separatist group, was implicated but not confirmed to be responsible for the bombing.
[

]
Although a handful of people were arrested and tried for the Air India bombing, the only person convicted was Inderjit Singh Reyat, who pleaded guilty in 2003 to
manslaughter
.
[
11
]
[
12
]
He was sentenced to fifteen years in prison for assembling the bombs that exploded on board Air India Flight 182 and at Narita.

The subsequent investigation and prosecution lasted almost twenty years. This was the most expensive trial in Canadian history, costing nearly
C$
130 million. The two accused, Ripudaman Singh Malik and Ajaib Singh Bagri, were both found not guilty.
The
Governor General-in-Council
in 2006 appointed the former
Supreme Court
Justice
John C. Major
to conduct a commission of inquiry into the failure to prevent the terrorist acts, compounded by the failure to achieve convictions of any perpetrators beyond the bomb maker. His report, which was completed and released on 17 June 2010, concluded that a "cascading series of errors" by the
Government of Canada
, the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police
(RCMP), and the
Canadian Security Intelligence Service
(CSIS) had allowed the militant attack to take place.

Background

Air India 182 memorial, Toronto
Memorial in
Ahakista
During the 1970s, many Sikhs emigrated to western Canada. These included men who later became leaders and members of the
Babbar Khalsa
including
Talwinder Singh Parmar
, Ajaib Singh Bagri, Ripudaman Singh Malik and Inderjit Singh Reyat. By the 1980s, the area around
Vancouver
,
British Columbia
, had become the largest centre of Sikh population outside India.
[
16
]
In India on 13 April 1978 a convention organised by the
Sant Nirankari Mission
took place at the time of the important Sikh festival of
Vaisakhi
, a celebration of the birth of
Khalsa
. The convention was led by
Gurbachan Singh
, leader of the Sant Nirankari Mission, and was organized in Amritsar with permission from the
Akali Dal
-led government of the state of
Punjab
. The practices of the Sant Nirankari were considered heresy by the school of orthodox Sikhism expounded by
Bhindranwale
.
[
17
]
A procession of about 200 Sikhs led by Bhindranwale and Fauja Singh of the
Akhand Kirtani Jatha
(AKJ) left the Golden Temple, heading towards the Nirankari Convention.
[
18
]
In the
ensuing violence
, several people were killed: two of Bhindranwale's followers, eleven members of the Akhand Kirtani Jatha and three Nirankaris.
[
19
]
A criminal case was filed against 62 Nirankaris who were charged by the Akali-led government in Punjab with the murder of 13 Sikhs. The case was heard in the neighbouring
Haryana
state, and all the accused were acquitted,
[
20
]
on the basis that they acted in
self-defence
. The Punjab government decided not to appeal the decision.
[
21
]
As a result of the Nirankaris receiving positive attention in the media, some orthodox Sikhs claimed this to be a conspiracy to defame the Sikh religion.
[
20
]
Bhindranwale increased his rhetoric against the perceived enemies of Sikhs. A letter of authority was issued by
Akal Takht
to ostracize the Sant Nirankaris and created an environment where some of his followers felt justified to kill the perceived enemies of Sikhism.
[
22
]
The chief proponents of this attitude were the
Babbar Khalsa
founded by the widow,
Bibi Amarjit Kaur
of the Akhand Kirtani Jatha; the
Damdami Taksal
led by
Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale
, who had also been in Amritsar on the day of the attack on the convention; the Dal Khalsa, formed with the object of demanding a sovereign Sikh state; and the
All India Sikh Students Federation
, which was banned by the government.
The founders of this
Panthan
group (sect) in Vancouver vowed to avenge the deaths of Sikhs. Talwinder Singh Parmar led the militant wing of AKJ, which became the Babbar Khalsa, to attack the Nirankaris. On 24 April 1980
Gurbachan Singh
, the
Baba
(head) of the Nirankaris, was killed. A member of the Akhand Kirtani Jatha, Ranjit Singh, surrendered and admitted to the assassination three years later, and was sentenced to serve thirteen years at the
Tihar Jail
in Delhi.
[
23
]
[
24
]
On 19 November 1981, Parmar was among the alleged militants who escaped from a shootout in which two Punjab Police officers were gunned down outside the house of
Amarjit Singh Nihang
in
Ludhiana district
. This added to the notoriety of Babbar Khalsa and its leader. He went to Canada.
[
25
]
In 1982, India issued a warrant for Parmar's arrest for six charges of murder, stemming from the killing of the police officers.
[
26
]
India notified Canada that Parmar was a wanted militant in 1981 and asked for his extradition in 1982. Canada denied the request in July 1982.
[
27
]
After an
Interpol
alert, Parmar was arrested while attempting to enter
West Germany
. West Germany chose to handle the case locally rather than transfer him over to India. Parmar went on a hunger strike to win his religious right to wear a turban and have vegetarian meals in the
Düsseldorf
jail. After India received information that Parmar had made assassination threats against
Indira Gandhi
, they found that Germany had decided that the evidence was weak.
[
28
]
In 1983, rebels led by Damdami Taksal
Jathedar
(leader)
Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale
occupied
Akal Takht
of
Golden Temple
and amassed weapons in the
Sikh temple
. They passed the
Anandpur Sahib Resolution
, which demanded that the state be given more powers from the Central government, and greater autonomy, by changes to the Indian constitution.
[
29
]
[
30
]
The total number of deaths was 410 in violent incidents and riots while 1,180 people were injured.
[
31
]
The Central government rejected the secessionist demands and on 3–6 June 1984,
Prime Minister of India
Indira Gandhi ordered
Operation Blue Star
, to remove the militants from the Golden Temple in which thousands of Sikhs were injured and killed as the Indian Army attacked the Golden Temple complex to remove Bhindrawale and his followers.
[
32
]
Sikhs protested against the operation worldwide. On 31 October 1984,
Indira Gandhi was assassinated
by two of her Sikh bodyguards. In retaliation, the
1984 anti-Sikh riots
, guided by certain
Indian National Congress
members, killed thousands of Sikhs in India.
[
33
]
Preparation
[
edit
]
Parmar visited Inderjit Singh Reyat, a car mechanic and electrician who lived in
Duncan, British Columbia
, a small community north of Victoria on Vancouver Island. He asked him to construct a bomb; Reyat later claimed he had no idea for what it would be used. Reyat asked various people in the community about dynamite, saying he wanted to remove tree stumps on his property.
[
34
]
Reyat also discussed explosives with a co-worker, while expressing anger at the Indian government and Indira Gandhi in particular.
[
35
]
Later that year, Ajaib Singh Bagri accompanied Parmar as his right-hand man in the militancy against the Indian government. Bagri worked as a forklift driver at a sawmill near the town of
Kamloops
. He was known as a powerful preacher in the
Indo-Canadian
community.
[
36
]
The pair travelled across Canada to incite Sikhs against the Indian government for conducting Operation Blue Star. They used the meetings as fundraisers for Babbar Khalsa. A former head priest in Hamilton testified that Bagri said, "The Indian Government is our enemy, the same way the Hindu society is our enemy."
[
37
]
Bagri told a congregation, "Get your weapons ready so we can take revenge against the Indian Government".

Timeline of the Air India Flight 182 affair
In late 1984, at least two informers reported to authorities on the first abortive plot to bomb Air India Flight 182, which then flew out of Montreal's
Mirabel International Airport
. In August 1984, the known criminal Gerry Boudreault claimed that Talwinder Parmar showed him a suitcase stuffed with $200,000 (~$496,427 in 2023) payment if he would plant a bomb on a plane. He decided, "I had done some bad things in my time, done my time in jail, but putting a bomb on a plane ... not me. I went to the police."
[
38
]
In September, in an attempt to get his sentence for theft and fraud reduced, Harmail Singh Grewal of Vancouver told the
Canadian Security Intelligence Service
(CSIS) and the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police
(RCMP) of the plot to bomb the flight from Montreal. Both reports were dismissed as unreliable. In June 1985, Paul Besso, an RCMP informant, claimed he had recorded Sikh militants on
Vancouver Island
discussing plans to bomb an Air India flight. Using an RCMP provided "body pack" and his wired van, Besso intended to record Sikh drug dealers but quickly realized they were militants. Besso claimed during a CBC interview that the entire meeting was recorded by Besso and provided to the RCMP a week before the bombing happened, with transcripts even stating that Air India was the target for the Sikh militants.

The moderate Sikh
Ujjal Dosanjh
had spoken out against violence by Sikh extremists. He was then injured in February 1985 by an assailant wielding an iron bar. His skull was broken severely and he required 80 stitches in his head. On 5 March 1985, three months before the bombing, the CSIS obtained a court order to place Parmar under surveillance for one year. Although the Babbar Khalsa had not yet been officially banned, the
affidavit
for surveillance stated, it "is a Sikh terrorist group now established in Canada", it "has claimed responsibility for more than forty assassinations of moderate Sikhs and other persons in the Punjab," and "penned its name to threatening letters [addressed to] ... high officials in India".
[
27
]
[

The affidavit said that on 15 July 1984, Parmar urged the Coach Temple congregation of
Calgary
,
Alberta
, to "unite, fight and kill" to avenge the attack on the Golden Temple.

Explosives and clocks
[
edit
]
In April 1985, a Canadian man familiar with explosives was asked by Reyat how much dynamite it would take to blow up a tree stump. Reyat asked numerous people in Duncan about explosives, and expressed the need for revenge. Reyat sought cases of dynamite and appeared willing to pay three times the normal price. He eventually confided to one acquaintance that it was not about stumps, but "trouble in the old country", that he needed "explosives to help my countrymen."
[
41
]
One friend declined to get him dynamite, but did lend him a 400-page manual on mining with explosives.
[
41
]
On 8 May 1985, Reyat bought a Micronta digital automobile clock at the
RadioShack
store in Duncan.
[
42
]
Designed for a 12-volt automobile electrical system, it could also be powered by a 12-volt lantern battery. The 24-hour alarm activated a buzzer. Reyat returned to the store a week later to buy an electrical relay, after asking how to get the buzzer signal to power another device.
Wiretappers
recorded nine telephone calls in one month between Reyat and Parmar's residence in Vancouver; Reyat called either from his residence or workplace on Vancouver Island. As a result of this activity, the government added Reyat to the list of persons being monitored for militant activities.
[
43
]
The Canadian government would later accuse Reyat of lying in 2003, when at first he said he did not know for what the three clocks he had bought could be used. He later said Parmar needed an explosive device to blow up a bridge or something large in India, and that he needed timers for an explosive device. The relay could be used to trigger the detonator circuit for a
blasting cap
, which would provide the initial shock needed to detonate larger explosives, such as dynamite.
[
34
]
[
35
]
Reyat later visited a television repair shop, seeking help for a partially disassembled car clock wired to a lantern battery. He claimed that he needed help so that the buzzer stayed on rather than intermittently beeping, so that it would turn on a light in his camper to wake him up. The repairman knew Reyat did not own a camper. Justice J. Raymond Paris said at Reyat's 1991 trial that this was an odd use for a timer.
[
44
]
Bomb tests
[
edit
]
By mid-May, Reyat had gone into the woods to test a device with a 12-volt battery, cardboard cylinder, gunpowder, and some dynamite, but the device failed to work.
[
45
]
The wooded area was in proximity to Duncan and
Paldi
. Later, Reyat acquired between six and eight sticks of dynamite "to blow up unidentified stumps if need be in the future" from a Duncan well driller after visiting his house to fix a truck. He also obtained a few blasting caps days later. On 31 May 1985, Reyat brought his timer, attached to a
boombox
, into his shop so that his fellow employee at Duncan Auto Marine Electric could help him fix it for a friend, but he returned the radio after it did not work properly.
On 4 June, CSIS agents Larry Lowe and Lynn Macadams followed Parmar and a "youthful man"
[
46
]
(identified only as "Mr. X", "Third Man" or "Unknown Male") as they went from Parmar's house to the
Horseshoe Bay
Ferry Terminal, rode the
Nanaimo
-bound ferry, and visited Reyat at his home and shop at Auto Marine Electric. The three drove to a deserted bush area, where Reyat was observed taking an object into the woods. Staying out of sight, the agents, who did not bring a camera, only heard a bang which sounded like a "loud gunshot".
[

]
Later tests showed it could also have been an explosion, and later searches turned up remnants of an aluminium "electrical blasting cap".
[
47
]
J.S. Warren, director-general of counter-terrorism at CSIS, would later ask the two CSIS agents on 16 July 1986 why they failed to ask the police to stop and question the suspects, or search the vehicle, which might have deterred the bombing plot. Warren also placed blame on the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, stating they also had the option to question the suspects but declined to do so for an unknown reason.
[
39
]
The next day, Reyat purchased a large Sanyo component tuner, model FMT 611 K, at
Woolworths
, and left his name and telephone number on the charge slip, which was later found in a search of his home. Reyat also bought smokeless gunpowder from a sporting goods store, signing "I. Reyat" on the explosives log. Study of debris from the Narita explosion would eventually show the bomb had been housed inside a Sanyo tuner with a serial number matching a model sold only in British Columbia, and used a Micronta clock as a timer, which powered a relay with an
Eveready
12-volt battery to trigger blasting caps to set off a high explosive consistent with sticks of dynamite,
[
43
]
all matching items purchased by Reyat. This would lead to his eventual conviction.
[
43
]
As late as 2010, Reyat admitted only to buying and assembling some parts, but denied he ever made a bomb, knew what the bomb was to be used for, who was behind any plot, or that he ever asked or knew the name of the man who he said stayed in his house for a week completing construction of the explosive device after his device failed.
[
48
]
On 9 June 1985, a police informer in Hamilton reported that Parmar and Bagri had visited the Malton Sikh Temple, warning the faithful that "it would be unsafe" to fly Air India.
[
49
]
Vancouver police also monitored militants 11 days before the bombing. A leader of the
International Sikh Youth Federation
complained that no Indian consuls or ambassadors had yet been killed, but was given the response of, "You will see. Something will be done in two weeks."
[
50
]
Tickets
[
edit
]
The suspects in the bombing used pay phones and talked in code. Translators' notes of wiretapped conversations include the following exchange between Talwinder Parmar and a follower named Hardial Singh Johal on 20 June 1985, the day the tickets were purchased:
Parmar: Did you write the story?
Johal: No, I didn't.
Parmar: Do that work first.
[
51
]
This conversation appears to be an order from Parmar to book the airline tickets.
[
52
]
It is believed that "writing the story" referred to purchasing the tickets; afterward, Johal phoned Parmar back and asked if he could "come over and read the story he asked for", to which Parmar agreed.
[
53
]
Moments after the wiretapped conversation, at 01:00
UTC
, a man calling himself "Mr. Singh" made reservations for two flights on 22 June: one for "Jaswant Singh" to fly from
Vancouver
to Toronto on
Canadian Pacific Air Lines
(CP) Flight 086 and one for "Mohinderbel Singh" to fly from Vancouver to Tokyo on Canadian Pacific Air Lines Flight 003 and connect to
Air India Flight 301
to
Delhi
via
Bangkok
. At 02:20 UTC on the same day, another call changed the reservation in the name of "Jaswant Singh" from CP 086 to CP 060, also flying from Vancouver to Toronto. The caller further requested to be put on the waiting list for AI 181 from Toronto to Montreal and AI 182 from Montreal to Bombay. The next day, at 19:10 UTC, a man wearing a turban paid for the two tickets with $3,005 in cash at a CP ticket office in Vancouver. The names on the reservations were changed: "Jaswant Singh" became "M. Singh" and "Mohinderbel Singh" became "L. Singh". The reservation and purchase of these tickets together would be used as evidence to link the two flights to one plot.
One telephone number left as a contact was Vancouver's Ross Street Sikh temple. The other number became one of the first leads tracked by investigators, and was traced to Hardial Singh Johal, a janitor at a Vancouver high school.
[
54
]
[
55
]
Johal was an avid follower of
Talwinder Singh Parmar
, and thus closely scrutinised in the investigation following the
Air India
bombing. He was alleged to have stored the suitcase explosives in the basement of a Vancouver school and to have purchased the tickets for the flights on which the bombs were placed. Mandip Singh Grewal recounted how he saw and recognised Johal as his school's janitor when he said goodbye to his father, one of the Flight 182 victims, at the airport on the day of the bombing.
[
56
]
Reyat went to work on 21 June. Phone records show he called Johal at 7:17 p.m. A witness whose name was protected testified that Bagri asked to borrow her car the night before the bombing to take some suitcases to the airport, though he would not be flying with them.
[
57
]
Aircraft
[
edit
]
The aircraft operating the flight was a
Boeing 747-237B
registered
VT-EFO and named
Emperor Kanishka
. The aircraft
first flew
on 19 June 1978 and was delivered to
Air India
in July 1978.
[
58
]
On 28 January 1983, the aircraft operating as Air India Flight 306 was damaged following a ground collision with an
Indian Airlines
Airbus A300
at
Palam Airport
. The aircraft was repaired and returned to service.
[

Bombings
[
edit
]
On 22 June 1985, at 13:30 UTC (6:30 a.m.
PDT
) a man calling himself "Manjit Singh" (checked in as M. Singh) called to confirm his reservations on Air India Flight 181/182. He was told he was still wait-listed, and was offered alternative arrangements, which he declined. At 15:50 UTC (8:50 a.m.), M. Singh checked into a busy line of 30 people for
Canadian Pacific Air Lines
(CP Air) Flight 60 from Vancouver to Toronto, which was scheduled to leave at 9:18 a.m. He asked agent Jeanne Bakermans to check his dark brown, hard-sided
Samsonite
suitcase, and have it transferred to Air India Flight 181 and then to Flight 182 to India. Bakermans initially refused his request to inter-line the baggage since his seat from Toronto to
Montreal
and from Montreal to
Bombay
was unconfirmed. He insisted, but the agent again rebuffed him, telling him, "Your ticket doesn't read that you're confirmed" and "we're not supposed to check your baggage through." The man said, "Wait, I'll get my brother for you." As he started to walk away, she relented and agreed to accept the bag, but told him he would have to check in again with Air India in Toronto. After the mass murders, Bakermans would realise this deception got the bag on its way to Air India Flight 182. The anxious man was never identified.
[
60
]
[
61
]
A few minutes later, Bakermans also accepted the check in of a passenger with the ticketed name L. Singh (later thought to possibly be the fake M. Singh's fake brother) for CP Air Flight 003 to Tokyo, with a confirmed connection there to Air India Flight 301 to New Delhi; L. Singh's suitcase contained ‘a second bomb, with which the terrorists intended to destroy Air India Flight 301 while mid-air to New Delhi, simultaneously with the mid-air destruction of Air India Flight 182, but instead killed
two baggage handlers in Japan
as it was being transferred to
Narita International Airport
.
[
60
]
[
61
]
At 16:18 UTC (9:18 a.m.),
[
62
]
CP Air Flight 60 departed Vancouver without M. Singh having boarded.
[
63
]
Reyat would later testify that he travelled by ferry from Duncan to Vancouver that morning to work on his brother's truck. Phone records show someone called from his residence in Duncan to Johal's number at 10:50 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. later that day. Reyat was seen in the company of another East Indian man at the Auto Marine Electric store in
Burnaby
, near Parmar's house, between 10:00 a.m. and 11:30 a.m.
[

]
He bought two 12 volt batteries similar to the one used in the explosive device tested in the woods, and they were to fit into a special metal bracket he had brought with him.
[
64
]
Constable Clark-Marlowe later believed there was "ample time for Inderjit Singh Reyat to obtain the batteries at the Auto Marine Electric limited store in Burnaby, incorporate the batteries in the assembly of an explosive device and then have the device transported in a suitcase to the Vancouver airport".
[

]
At 20:22 UTC (4:22 p.m.
EDT
), Canadian Pacific Air Lines Flight 60 arrived in Toronto twelve minutes late. Some of the passengers and baggage, including the bag M. Singh had checked in, were transferred to Air India Flight 182. In response to threats from Sikh activists, Air India had requested extra security, leading Canada to assign extra policemen in terminals in Toronto and Montreal, and all baggage was to be checked by X-ray or by hand.
[
65
]
But after the x-ray machine broke down that day, inspectors used a portable PDD-4 explosive sniffer. An Air India security officer had demonstrated that it made a loud scream when a lit match was held an inch away, and showed that it should be used around the edge of the bag being tested. Between 5:15 and 6:00, the sniffer was heard to beep at a soft-sided maroon suitcase with a zipper going all around; it beeped in a low volume near the zipper lock. But Air India was not informed since checkers were not instructed on how to react to only a short beep, so they allowed the bag to pass on its way. Later investigation would determine that the two containers that could have contained M. Singh's bag were placed close to the sensitive electronic bay of the aircraft.
[

At 00:15 UTC (8:15 p.m., 22 June) on 23 June, Air India Flight 181, a Boeing 747-237B named
Emperor
Kanishka
, departed
Toronto Pearson International Airport
for
Montréal–Mirabel International Airport
. The aircraft was an hour and 40 minutes late because a "
fifth pod
" (a spare engine) was installed under the aircraft below the left wing to be flown to India for repairs. Some of the parts had to be stored in the rear cargo compartment. The 5th pod engine was a serviceable spare engine that had been on lease to
Air Canada
after one of their Boeing 747s suffered an engine failure on the way to India. That engine received a post lease inspection and was declared serviceable by Air Canada personnel.
The plane arrived in Montréal-Mirabel International Airport at 01:00 UTC (9:00 p.m., 22 June). There, it became Flight 182.

Flight 182 departed for
London Heathrow Airport

Many of the passengers were going to visit family and friends.

At 07:09:58 GMT (8:09:58 a.m.
Irish time
), the crew of the Boeing 747 "squawked 2005"
[
74

(a routine activation of its
aviation transponder
) as requested by
Shannon Airport
Air Traffic Control (ATC), then disappeared from the radar screens five minutes later. At 07:14:01 GMT (8:14:01 a.m. Irish time), a bomb hidden in a
Sanyo
tuner
[

in a suitcase in the forward cargo hold exploded while the plane was at 31,000 feet (9,400 m) at
51°3.6′N

﻿ / ﻿
51.0600°N 12.817°W

It caused
explosive decompression
and the break-up of the aircraft in mid-air. The wreckage settled in 6,700 feet (2,000 m) deep water off the south-west Irish coast, 120 miles (190 km) offshore of
County Cork
. No "
mayday
" call was received by Shannon ATC. ATC asked aircraft in the area to try to contact Air India, to no avail. By 07:30:00 GMT, ATC had declared an emergency and requested nearby cargo ships and the
Irish Naval Service
vessel
LÉ
Aisling
to look out for the aircraft.
Meanwhile, sometime before 20:22 UTC (1:22 p.m. PDT), L. Singh (also never identified) checked in for the 1:37 p.m. CP Air Flight 003 to Tokyo with one piece of luggage, which was to be transferred to
Air India Flight 301
to Bangkok.
[

However, L. Singh did not board the flight.
[

]
The second bag checked in by L. Singh went on Canadian Pacific Air Lines Flight 003 from
Vancouver
to
Tokyo
. There were no x-ray inspections of luggage on this flight.
[
66
]
Its target was
Air India Flight 301
, due to leave with 177 passengers and crew bound for
Bangkok-Don Mueang
, but 55 minutes before the Flight 182 bombing, it exploded at the terminal in
Narita International Airport
. Two Japanese
baggage handlers
were killed and four other people were injured. It appears the conspirators meant for both bombings to occur simultaneously, but they neglected to take into account that Japan does not observe
daylight saving time
, as Canada does.

Recovery of wreckage and bodies
[

Irish Naval Service recovering bodies from the Air India Flight 182 disaster
By 09:13 UTC, the cargo ship
Laurentian Forest
discovered wreckage of the aircraft and many bodies floating in the water. India's civil aviation minister announced the possibility that the plane had been destroyed by a bomb, and the cause was probably some sort of explosion.
[
78
]
Previous 747s had been damaged or destroyed on the ground, and
Korean Air Lines Flight 007
had been shot down by fighter jets, but this was the first jumbo jet downed by a bomb on board.
[
79
]
The bomb killed all 22 crew and 307 passengers. Of those, 132 bodies were recovered; 197 were lost at sea. Eight bodies exhibited "flail pattern" injuries, indicating that they had exited the aircraft before it hit the water. This was a sign that the aircraft had broken up in mid-air. Twenty-six bodies showed signs of
hypoxia
(lack of oxygen). Twenty-five, mostly victims who were seated near windows, showed signs of explosive decompression. Twenty-three had signs of "injuries from a vertical force". Twenty-one passengers were found with little or no clothing.
[
80
]
One official quoted in the report stated:
"All victims have been stated in the PM reports to have died of multiple injuries. Two of the dead, one infant and one child, are reported to have died of asphyxia. There is no doubt about the asphyxial death of the infant. In the case of the other child (Body No 93) there was some doubt because the findings could also be caused due to the child undergoing tumbling or spinning with the anchor point at the ankles. Three other victims undoubtedly died of drowning."
[
81
]
Two of these drowning victims, a pregnant woman in her second trimester and her unborn son, were described by John Hogan in testimony given at a coroner's inquest convened in
Cork
on 17 September 1985:
The other significant findings were large amounts of frothy fluid in her mouth and nostrils, and all of the air passages and the lungs were water-logged and extremely heavy. There was water in the stomach and the uterine. The uterus contained a normal male fetus of approximately five months. The foetus was not traumatized and in my opinion death was due to drowning.

Gardline Locater
Additional evidence to support a bombing was retrieved from the broken-up aircraft, which lay on the sea bed at a depth of 6,700 feet (2,000 m).
[
83
]
The British vessel
Gardline Locater
, equipped with sophisticated
sonar
, and the French cable-laying vessel
Léon Thévenin
, with its
remotely operated underwater vehicle
Scarab 1
, were dispatched to locate the
flight data recorder
(FDR) and
cockpit voice recorder
(CVR) boxes. The boxes would be difficult to find and it was imperative that the search commence quickly. By 4 July,
Gardline Locator
detected signals on the sea bed. On 9 July,
Scarab 1
pinpointed the CVR and raised it to the surface. The next day, the FDR was also located and recovered. In 1985, the Canadian Coast Guard Ship (CCGS)
John Cabot
participated in the investigations, mapping the underwater wreckage of the aircraft.

There were 29 entire families on the plane. Two children not on board had both parents on board, resulting in them becoming orphaned. There were six sets of parents who lost their children, and an additional 32 people not on the aircraft who had the remaining members of their families on board.
[

Most of the victims resided in
southern Ontario
and were Hindus. Some of the victims were Sikhs;
[

around 35 passengers were Sikhs from
Greater Montreal
.
[

In terms of metropolitan areas, the
Greater Toronto Area
was the home of the majority of the passengers, with Greater Montreal also having the next largest number of passengers.

Some passengers originated from British Columbia.

Gurpreet Singh wrote in the
Georgia Straight
that "B.C. has far fewer Air India victims' families than Ontario."

Forty-five passengers were employees of Air India or relatives of Air India employees.

Notable passengers and crew included
Inder Thakur
, an Air India
purser
and former actor along with his wife and son; and
Yelavarthy Nayudamma
, a scientist and chemical engineer.
Among the passengers on Flight 182, 105 had boarded the flight at
Mirabel Airport
, while 202 had boarded at
Toronto Pearson Airport
.
[

The report stated that interlining passengers boarding Flight 181 in Toronto who became passengers on Flight 182 included ten passengers connecting from
Vancouver
, five passengers from
Winnipeg
, four passengers from
Edmonton
, and two passengers from
Saskatoon
. It stated that all of these passengers had taken flights on Air Canada,

There were 68 persons who cleared customs in Toronto and were scheduled to re-board Flight 181 so they could travel to their final destination, Montreal. There was a practice of passengers who intended to fly to Toronto actually buying tickets to Montreal, because tickets to Montreal had a lower cost than tickets to Toronto. On the flights going to Canada, such passengers simply disembarked in Toronto and
chose not to re-board the flight
to Montreal. Three passengers scheduled to go onward to Montreal never re-boarded Flight 181, and so there were 65 passengers destined for Montreal who flew the Toronto-to-Montreal segment.

Investigations

A
commemorative plaque
presented to the citizens of
Bantry
, Ireland, by the
government of Canada
for the residents' kindness and compassion to the families of the victims of Air India Flight 182
Within hours, Canada's Indian community was a focus of attention as victims and among hints that officials were investigating connections to the Sikh separatists who had threatened and committed acts of violence in retaliation against Hindus.
[
101
]
In the subsequent worldwide investigations over six years, many threads of the plot were uncovered. Based on recovery of wreckage and bodies from the surface, it was decided to retrieve wreckage and recorders from the bottom of the sea. That voice and flight recorders were cut out at the same time, and damage to parts recovered from the forward cargo bay consistent with a blast, established that it was probably a bomb near the forward cargo hold that brought the plane down suddenly. The flight was also soon linked to the earlier bombing in Japan which had also originated from Vancouver; tickets for both flights had been purchased by the same person, and in both cases the planes were carrying bags without the passenger who checked them in.
[
102
]
One of the problems the investigators thought may have been the reason of the supposed crash was that the aircraft was carrying a spare engine to a maintenance facility. Therefore, there would have been more weight on one side. This reason was ruled out as the flight recorders relayed information of the rudder position which assists in the carrying of a 5th engine.
No bomb parts were recovered from the ocean, but investigations of the blast at Tokyo established that the bomb had been placed in a Sanyo stereo tuner of a series that had been shipped to Vancouver in Canada. The RCMP assigned no less than 135 officers to check every store that could have sold Sanyo tuners, leading to the discovery of a recent sale to mechanic Inderjit Singh Reyat in his hometown of
Duncan, British Columbia
. RCMP contacted the CSIS and found they were already investigating the Sikh activists; RCMP learned that CSIS already had wiretaps and had observed Reyat and Parmar at the test blast near Duncan, and had recovered blasting cap shunts and a paper bundle wrapper from a blasting cap.
[
103
]
A search recovered the receipt for a Sanyo Tuner Model FMT-611K with invoice with his name and phone number, along with sales of other bomb components.
[
104
]
It was not until January 1986 that Canadian investigators at the
Canadian Aviation Safety Board
concluded that a bomb explosion in the forward cargo hold had downed the airliner.
[
105
]
On 26 February 1986, Supreme Court Judge Kirpal of India presented an inquiry report based on investigation conducted by H.S. Khola (the "
Khola Report
"). The report also concluded that a bomb originating in Canada brought down the Air India flight.
[
68
]
Based on observations, wiretaps, searches and arrests of persons believed to be participants, the bombing was determined to be the joint project of at least two Sikh militant groups with extensive membership in Canada, the United States, Britain and India. Militant Sikhs were angered by the destruction of the
Golden Temple
and deaths of Sikhs during India's
ground assault on separatists
,
[

as well as the
1984 anti-Sikh riots
.
[

Suspects
[
edit
]
The multiple suspects in the bombing were members of a
Khalistani
group called the
Babbar Khalsa
(banned in Europe and the United States as a proscribed militant group) and other related groups who were at the time agitating for a separate
Sikh
state (called
Khalistan
) in
Punjab, India
.
[
108
]
Talwinder Singh Parmar
(26 February 1944 – 15 October 1992) – a Canadian citizen born in Punjab and living in
British Columbia
, was a high-ranking official in the Babbar Khalsa. His phone was tapped by CSIS for three months before the bombing.
[
27
]
He was originally believed to have been killed during a gunfight between officers of the
Punjab Police
and six Sikh militants. According to the First information report by the Punjab Police, Parmar was killed by
AK-47
fire from a rooftop at 5:30a.m on 15 October 1992. However, this account is disputed by post-mortem report suggesting he was killed between 12a.m and 2a.m. However, the investigative newsmagazine
Tehelka
alleged that Parmar was executed without trial after 4 days of interrogation and torture by the Punjab Police on 15 October 1992. Tehelka also stated that Parmar believed he was framed for the attack, alleging
Lakhbir Singh Rode
planned the Air India 182 bombing. Contrary to what Tehelkha suggested in the same article, the RCMP did not believe Rode had any role in the bombing and established Parmar as one of the masterminds behind the bombing.
[

Inderjit Singh Reyat
(born 11 March 1952) – was born in
India
, but moved to the
United Kingdom
with his family in 1965 and later to Canada in 1974, and holds dual
British
and
Canadian
citizenship. He worked as an auto mechanic and electrician in
Duncan, British Columbia
on
Vancouver Island
. Investigation of the bombing in Tokyo led to discovery that he had bought a Sanyo radio, clocks and other parts found after the blast. He was convicted of manslaughter for constructing the bomb. As part of a deal, he was to testify against others, but as he declined to implicate others, he would be the only suspect convicted in the case.
[

Reyat was released to halfway house in 2016
[

and now fully released with some restrictions since early 2017 to his family's home in BC.

Ajaib Singh Bagri
(born 4 October 1949) – a
mill
worker living in
Kamloops

Hindus

Ripudaman Singh Malik
(4 February 1947 – 14 July 2022) A Vancouver businessman who was involved with opening Khalsa Credit Union and Khalsa Schools. He was charged in 2000 but acquitted in 2005.
[
114

In July 2022, Malik was murdered in
Surrey, British Columbia
. The RCMP arrested two individuals in his murder, who later pled guilty to second-degree murder.
[

Surjan Singh Gill
(born 19 October 1942) – was living in Vancouver as the self-proclaimed
consul-general
of Khalistan. Some RCMP testimony claimed he was a
mole
who left the plot just days before its execution because he was told to pull out, but the Canadian government denied that report. He later fled Canada and was believed in August 2003 to be hiding in London, England.

Hardial Singh Johal
(20 November 1946 – 15 November 2002) – a follower of Parmar who was active in the
Gurdwaras
where Parmar preached. On 15 November 2002, Johal died of natural causes at age 55. His phone number was left when ordering the airline tickets, he was seen at the airport the day the luggage was loaded, and he had allegedly stored the suitcases containing the bombs in the basement of a Vancouver school, but was never charged in the case.

Sandhu was cleared by Judge
Ian Josephson

Lakhbir Singh Rode
– the leader of the Sikh separatist organisation
International Sikh Youth Federation
. In September 2007, the commission investigated reports, initially disclosed in the Indian investigative news magazine
Tehelka
,
[

that Parmar had allegedly confessed and named the hitherto-unnamed Lakhbir Singh Rode as the mastermind behind the explosions.
[
120
]
This claim appears to be inconsistent with other evidence known to the RCMP.
[
121
]
On 17 August 1985, Reyat became a third suspect once the receipt for the tuner was found with his name. On 6 November 1985, the RCMP raided the homes of Parmar, Reyat, Gill and Johal.
[
citation needed
]
In a
4
+
1
⁄
2
-hour interview, Reyat denied all knowledge of the test blast or even Parmar. After he was told the CSIS had seen both of them, he changed his story that Parmar really wanted to build a device powerful enough so that he could take the device back to India to destroy a bridge. He explained that the gunpowder in the test was a failure, as the device fizzled. The search of Reyat's house produced a carton with an unusual green tape also found in the Narita blast and a can of Liquid Fire-brand starting fluid matching fragments found at the blast site, along with blasting caps and dynamite, including a pound of dynamite in a bag taken out its original tube casing, though none was consistent with blast residue. Reyat insisted only the clock, relays and tuner had been purchased for other than "benign purposes". There was insufficient evidence to hold Parmar as charges were dropped days later.
Bagri would later state before his later trial that he knew he was probably a suspect by October 1985, but insisted he would have faced charges if there were any evidence he had anything to do with the bombing.
[
122
]
It was established by November that it was a man with a Sikh name who probably checked the bag in Vancouver that caused the crash.
[
105
]
Parmar was not seen in Canada after sometime in late 1986. He ultimately returned to India, where he was killed in a shootout with police in 1992.
[
123
]
Trials
[
edit
]
Authorities initially lacked evidence to link Inderjit Singh Reyat directly to either the Narita or Air India blasts and pursue a conspiracy to commit murder charge. Instead, Reyat pleaded guilty on 29 April 1986 to possession of an explosive substance and possession of an unregistered firearm. His sentence was a light $2,000 fine. Just three months later, Reyat moved his family from Canada to
Coventry
, near Birmingham, in the UK. Reyat was soon hired at a Jaguar factory where he worked for nearly two years.
[
124
]
Mounties
working with prosecutor Jardine and RCMP and Japanese experts eventually determined the components of the bomb from fragments and matched them with items that Reyat possessed or had purchased. Prosecutor Jardine visited Tokyo five times to meet with Japanese authorities, and Canada formally asked that evidence to be sent to Canada. Still lacking sufficient evidence for a murder charge, Jardine recommended two manslaughter charges and five explosives-related counts, resulting in a request to Britain to extradite Reyat, who was arrested on 5 February 1988 as he was driving to the Jaguar car plant. After lengthy proceedings to extradite him from Britain, Reyat was flown to Vancouver on 13 December 1989 and his trial began 18 September 1990. On 10 May 1991, he was convicted of two counts of manslaughter and four explosives charges relating to the Narita Airport bombing. He was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment.
[
125
]
Fifteen years after the bombing, on 27 October 2000, RCMP arrested Malik and Bagri. They were charged with 329 counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of the people on board Air India Flight 182, conspiracy to commit murder, the attempted murder of passengers and crew on the Canadian Pacific flight at Japan's New Tokyo International Airport (now Narita International Airport), and two counts of murder of the baggage handlers at New Tokyo International Airport.
[
126
]
[
127
]
It became known as the "Air India Trial".
[
128
]
On 6 June 2001, RCMP arrested Reyat, who was about to finish his earlier 10-year-sentence, on charges of murder, attempted murder, and conspiracy in the Air India bombing.
[
citation needed
]
On 10 February 2003, Reyat pleaded guilty to one count of manslaughter for aiding in the construction of a bomb. He was sentenced to five years in prison.
[
129
]
The court claimed Reyat was guilty of helping make the bomb, but that he lacked any knowledge of how it would be used and lacked an intent to kill. He was expected to provide testimony in the trial of Malik and Bagri, but prosecutors were vague.
[
130
]
The trial of Malik and Bagri proceeded between April 2003 and December 2004 in Courtroom 20,
[
131
]
more commonly known as "the Air India courtroom". At a cost of $7.2 million, (~$10.8 million in 2023) the high-security courtroom was specially built for the trial in the
Vancouver Law Courts
.
[
132
]
On 16 March 2005, Justice Ian Josephson found the two accused not guilty on all counts because the evidence was inadequate:
I began by describing the horrific nature of these cruel acts of terrorism, acts which cry out for justice. Justice is not achieved, however, if persons are convicted on anything less than the requisite standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Despite what appear to have been the best and most earnest of efforts by the police and the Crown, the evidence has fallen markedly short of that standard.
[
133
]
In a letter to the
Attorney General of British Columbia
, Malik demanded compensation from the Canadian government for
wrongful prosecution
in his arrest and trial. Malik owes the government $6.4 million and Bagri owes $9.7 million in legal fees.
[
134

[

On 14 July 2022, Ripudaman Singh Malik, one of the men acquitted in the 1985 Air India militant bombings, was shot to death in Surrey, B.C.
[

Reyat's perjury trial
[
edit
]
In February 2006, Inderjit Singh Reyat was charged with
perjury
with regard to his testimony in the trial.
[
137
]
The indictment was filed in the
Supreme Court of British Columbia
and lists 27 instances in which Reyat allegedly misled the court during his testimony. Reyat had pleaded guilty to constructing the bomb, but denied under oath that he knew anything about the conspiracy.
In the verdict, Justice Josephson said:
I find him to be an unmitigated liar under oath. Even the most sympathetic of listeners could only conclude, as do I, that his evidence was patently and pathetically fabricated in an attempt to minimise his involvement in his crime to an extreme degree, while refusing to reveal relevant information he clearly possesses."
[
138
]
On 3 July 2007, with perjury proceedings still pending, Reyat was denied parole by the
National Parole Board
, which concluded he was a continued risk to the public. The decision meant Reyat had to serve his full five-year sentence, which ended 9 February 2008.
[
139
]
Reyat's perjury trial began in March 2010 in Vancouver, but was abruptly dismissed on 8 March 2010. The jury was dismissed after "biased" remarks were made about Reyat by a woman juror.
[
140
]
A new jury was chosen. In September 2010, according to the
Lethbridge Herald
newspaper, jurors were told Reyat had lied 19 times under oath.
[
141
]
On 19 September 2010, Reyat was convicted of perjury.
[
142
]
On 7 January 2011, he was sentenced to 9 years in prison by Justice Mark McEwan, who remarked that Reyat "behaved nothing like a remorseful man unwittingly implicated in mass murder," adding that, "[i]n the
witness box
, Mr. Reyat behaved like a man still committed to a cause which treated hundreds of men, women and children [as] expendable."
[
142
]
[
143
]
In February 2011, Reyat filed an appeal stating that the judge "erred in law, misdirected the jury and failed to tell jurors there was no evidence to support portions of the Crown's closing address," and called it "harsh and excessive," asking for a new trial.
[
144
]
In January 2013, the
Supreme Court of Canada
rejected Reyat's bid to appeal his perjury conviction. The country's top court did not disclose its reasons as per customary practice.
[
145
]
In March 2014, the
British Columbia Court of Appeal
dismissed Reyat's appeal that the 9-year length of the sentence, the country's longest sentence for perjury, was unfit. The court ruled the gravity of the perjury in such a case was without comparison.
[
146
]
Parole
[
edit

On 28 January 2016, Inderjit Singh Reyat was released on
parole
. He was released from a
halfway house
less than 13 months later, on 14 February 2017, with restrictions.

Mistakes and missed opportunities
[
edit
]
Previous warning
[
edit
]
The Canadian government had been warned by the Indian
R&AW
about the possibility of militant bombs aboard Air India flights in Canada, and over two weeks before the crash,
CSIS
reported to the
RCMP
that the potential threat to Air India as well as Indian missions in Canada was high.
[
47
]
In June 1985, there was an Air India
telex
message that suggested planes could be targeted by "time delay devices." Lieutenant-Governor of Ontario
James Bartleman
also testified that, as a senior intelligence official in the federal
Department of External Affairs
, he saw a security "intercept" with a specific warning of a threat against the airline on the weekend of the bombing.
[
143
]
Destroyed evidence
[
edit
]
In his verdict, Justice
Ian Josephson
cited "unacceptable negligence" by CSIS when hundreds of
wiretaps
of the suspects and other informants were destroyed.
[
148
]
[
149
]
Of the 210 wiretaps that were recorded during the months before and after the bombing, 156 were erased. These tapes continued to be erased even after the militants had become the primary suspects in the bombing.
[
150
]
Because the original wiretap records were erased, they were inadmissible as evidence in court.
[
151
]
CSIS claimed the wiretap recordings contained no relevant information, but an RCMP memo states that "There is a strong likelihood that had CSIS retained the tapes between March and August 1985, that a successful prosecution of at least some of principals in both bombings could have been undertaken."
[
152
]
"The CSIS investigation was so badly bungled that there was a near mutiny by CSIS officers involved in the probe," said the agent who destroyed the tapes once he had been granted anonymity in January 2000 by
Globe and Mail
journalists.
[
149
]
One agent "said he felt compelled to destroy the tapes (that were in his possession) because he was morally obliged to do everything in his power to protect the safety of his sources. '[I] decided it was a moral issue... If their identity had become known in the Sikh community, they would have been killed. There is no doubt in my mind about that.' "
[

]
Murdered witnesses
[
edit
]
Tara Singh Hayer
, the publisher of the
Indo-Canadian Times
and a member of the
Order of British Columbia
,
[
153
]
provided an
affidavit
to the RCMP in 1995 claiming that he was present during a conversation in which Bagri admitted his involvement in the bombings.
[
154
]
While at the London offices of fellow Sikh newspaper publisher
Tarsem Singh Purewal
, Hayer claimed he overheard a meeting between Purewal and Bagri in which Bagri stated that "if everything had gone as planned the plane would have blown up at Heathrow airport with no passengers on it.
[
154
]
But because the plane was a half-hour to three quarters of an hour late, it blew up over the ocean."
[
154
]
On 24 January that same year, Purewal was killed near the offices of the
Des Pardes
newspaper in
Southall
, England, leaving Hayer as the only other witness.
[
155
]
On 18 November 1998, Hayer was shot dead while getting out of his car in the garage of his home in
Surrey, British Columbia
.
[
156
]
Hayer had survived an earlier attempt on his life in 1988, but was paralysed and used a wheelchair.
[
156
]
As a consequence of his murder, the affidavit was inadmissible as
evidence
.
[
157
]
This was later cited as a reason why the suspects in the bombing were eventually acquitted in 2005.
[

CSIS connection
[
edit
]
During an interview with Bagri on 28 October 2000, RCMP agents described
Surjan Singh Gill
as an agent for
CSIS
, saying the reason that he resigned from the Babbar Khalsa was because his CSIS handlers told him to pull out.
[
158
]
After the subsequent failure of CSIS to stop the bombing of Flight 182, the head of CSIS was replaced by
Reid Morden
. In an interview for
CBC Television
's news program
The National
, Morden claimed that CSIS "dropped the ball" in its handling of the case. A
Security Intelligence Review Committee
cleared CSIS of any wrongdoing. However, that report remains secret to this day. As of June 2003, the Canadian government continued to insist that there was no
mole
involved.

Public inquiry
[

On 1 May 2006, the Crown-in-Council, on the advice of Prime Minister
Stephen Harper
,
[
161
]
announced the launch of a full
public inquiry
into the bombing, headed by retired
Supreme Court
Justice
John Major
, to find investigate the events surrounding the bombing and the subsequent investigation, as well as to identify gaps in Canada's security and intelligence system.
[
143
]
[
162
]
[
163
]
Initiated later in June, the
Commission of Inquiry into the Investigation of the Bombing of Air India Flight 182
was to examine how
Canadian law
restricted funding
terrorist groups
,
[
164
]
how well
witness protection
is provided in terrorist cases, if Canada needed to upgrade its
airport security
, and if issues of co-operation between the RCMP, CSIS, and other law enforcement agencies had been resolved. It was to also provide a forum wherein families of the victims could testify on the impact of the bombing and would not repeat any criminal trials.
[
165
]
The inquiry's findings were published on 17 June 2010 in its final report,
Air India Flight 182: A Canadian Tragedy
.
[
166

The report was 4,000 pages long, with 5 volumes and 64 recommendations.
[

Major concluded that a "cascading series of errors" by
Crown ministries

He called for the Canadian government's
National Security Advisor
to be given responsibility for preventing conflict between agencies, as well as calling for a national director of terrorism prosecutions, a new coordinator of witness protection for terrorism cases, and broad changes to close the gaps in airport security.

As per recommendation of the inquiry, Stephen Harper announced in the media, a week after the report and on the 25th anniversary of the disaster, that he would "acknowledge the catastrophic failures of intelligence, policing and air security that led to the bombing, and the prosecutorial lapses that followed" and deliver an apology on behalf of the government of Canada.

Air India Flight 182 memorial in Toronto, Ontario
Monument and playground in
Stanley Park
, Vancouver, commemorating victims of Flight 182, dedicated July 2007
On 23 June 2005, 20 years after the downing of Air India Flight 182, Prime Minister
Paul Martin
attended a memorial service in
Ahakista
,
West Cork
, Ireland, with victims' families to grieve. This would be the first time a
Canadian Prime Minister
had visited the Irish memorial, which was built after the bombing.
[
143
]
Governor General
Adrienne Clarkson
, on the advice of Martin, declared the anniversary a
national day of mourning
. During the anniversary observances, Martin said that the bombing was a Canadian problem, not a foreign problem, saying,
Make no mistake: The flight may have been Air India's, it may have taken place off the coast of Ireland, but this is a Canadian tragedy.
[

Ujjal Dosanjh
, the moderate Sikh who had been attacked in a prelude to the Air India bombing, was by this time a member of Martin's cabinet as federal Minister of Health, and had previously in the interim been Premier of British Columbia.
On the morning of 14 July 2022 Ripudaman Singh Malik was shot several times and died outside his family business, Papillon Eastern Imports, on 128 Street in Surrey, British Columbia.
Memorials
[
edit
]
Memorials were erected in Canada and elsewhere to commemorate the victims. In 1986, a monument was unveiled in Ahakista, Ireland, on the first anniversary of the bombing.
[
170
]
[
171
]
Subsequently, a groundbreaking occurred on 11 August 2006 at a playground that would form part of a memorial in
Stanley Park
, Vancouver,
British Columbia
.
[
172
]
Another memorial was unveiled on 22 June 2007 in
Humber Bay Park
East, Toronto, Ontario; many of the bombing victims had lived in Toronto. The memorial features a sundial, the base of which consists of stones from all provinces and territories of Canada, as well as the countries of the other victims, and a wall, oriented toward Ireland and bearing the names of the dead.
[
173
]
A third Canadian memorial opened in
Ottawa
in 2014.
[
174
]
A fourth memorial was unveiled in
Lachine
,
Montreal
on the 26th anniversary of the tragedy.
[
175
]
There are no memorials in India as of yet.
[
175
]
In 2024, Khalistani supporters and activists disrupted memorials to the Air India victims, and carried signs promoting the conspiracy theory that the Indian government was involved in the bombing, in close proximity to the victims' families. They occasionally clashed with mourners.

Public memory
[
edit
]
2006
[
edit
]
Monique Castonguay, whose sister-in-law, Rachelle Castonguay, was one of the murder victims, testified at the public Commission of Inquiry in October 2006. During her testimony, she revealed that many non-Asian Canadians, including journalists, that the family had talked to since the Canadian terrorists had murdered 331 people in the coordinated terrorist bombings 21 years earlier – including 268 Canadian citizens, were surprised to learn that "there were white people on board" Air India Flight 182.
[
177
]
Castonguay called this "an example of the racial stereotyping that afflicted many non-Asian Canadians" with regard to the bombings.
[
177
]
2007
[
edit
]
In May 2007,
Angus Reid Strategies
released the results of public opinion polling of whether Canadians viewed the Air India bombing as a Canadian or Indian tragedy and whom they blamed: 48% of respondents considered the bombing as a Canadian event, while 22% thought it was a mostly Indian affair; 34% of those asked felt both CSIS and airport security personnel deserved a great deal of the blame in addition to 27% who believed the RCMP were largely to blame; 18% mentioned
Transport Canada
.
[
178
]
Ken MacQueen and John Geddes of
Maclean's
said that the Air India bombing has been referred to as "Canada's
9/11
." They disagreed, however, stating the following:
In truth, it was never close to that. The date, 23 June 1985, is not seared into the nation's soul. The events of that day snuffed out hundreds of innocent lives and altered the destinies of thousands more, but it neither shook the foundations of government, nor transformed its policies. It was not, in the main, even officially acknowledged as an act of terrorism.
[
179
]
2023
[
edit
]
In 2023, 38 years after the attack, an
Angus Reid Institute
study discovered that nine out of ten Canadians had little to no knowledge of the attack, and only one in every five Canadians correctly classified the bombing as one of the worst acts of mass murder in Canadian history.
[
180
]
In the study, participants were questioned about their familiarity with the bombs planted by separatist Sikh extremists advocating for a separate Sikh state in Punjab, India. The results indicated that 61% of respondents claimed to have limited knowledge on the matter, while 28% admitted to having no knowledge at all.
[
180
]
According to the study, it appears that the recent attack has had minimal influence on individuals who were born after the Air India bombings. The research reveals that 58% of people aged 35 and younger were unaware of the militant attack altogether. This suggests that only a small portion, around one in 10 respondents, possessed a substantial understanding of the events and their consequences. Among those who were aware, merely 34% correctly acknowledged that the culprits behind the attack were not convicted of murder in a court of law.
[
180
]
2025
[
edit
]
In 2025, 40 years after the attack, a poll by the
Angus Reid Institute
revealed that a majority of Canadians said the attack was not being treated as a "national tragedy".
[

  title: Air India crash: DNA profiling complete, final death toll stands at 260
  content: ANI
The debris of the Air India crash in Ahmedabad
The final death toll in the
Air India Flight 171 crash
stands at 260, officials in Gujarat said two weeks after the Boeing 787 Dreamliner crashed immediately after taking-off from the city's airport.
The death toll of 260 includes 241 passengers and crew aboard the plane and 19 people on the ground. The figure is lower than the earlier estimate of 270 deaths.
Authorities had collected 318 bodies and body parts from the crash site which were sent for DNA testing. The state government has praised the quick identification through DNA testing, adding that it would have taken five to ten days to establish the identities of the individuals a couple of days ago.
Director of Forensic Science, HP Sanghvi, said in a statement released by the state government, "This incident was not just another case for FSL, but a matter of hope and emotion for countless families. That’s why all FSL teams from Gandhinagar, Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Surat, and Rajkot were immediately mobilized to Gandhinagar to expedite the DNA profiling process and ensure the swift handover of the victims' bodies to their families."
Later on Saturday, state health minister Rushikesh Patel said, "A total of 260 deceased have been identified in the plane crash so far, including 254 through DNA tests and 6 through facial recognition, all of which have been handed over to their families."
Live Events
Among the 260 people, 181 are Indian citizens, seven have been identified as Portuguese, 52 are British nationals, one Canadian and 19 non-passengers.
The Air India flight to London crashed soon after taking off on 12 June from Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport, destroying portions of a medical college building and bursting into flames.
Among the victims were junior doctors, staff at the hospital complex and people on the street below. One passenger, walked out of the crash after he was thrown further away from the burning wreckage.
The impact of the crash and the inferno that followed meant remains of most victims, except for most of the 19 casualties on the ground, were unrecognisable, requiring officials to seek DNA samples from family members to help make the identification.
Among the 260 deaths, 254 victims were identified through DNA testing and the remaining through facial recognition. The DNA identification process, which typically takes months, was completed in approximately two weeks, experts said.

Top Questions
Where did Air India flight 171 crash?
In June 2025 Air India flight 171 crashed about five minutes after taking off from Ahmedabad Airport, west-central India. The plane, a Boeing 787 Dreamliner, was headed to London and had 242 passengers and crew on board. The aircraft crashed into a local medical college.
When was Air India founded and under what name?
Air India was founded in 1932 as Tata Airlines.
Who owns Air India?
In 2021 Air India was sold to the
Tata Group
.
Air India
,  airline founded in 1932 (as Tata Airlines) that grew into the flagship international airline of
India
; in addition to domestic routes, it serves southern and eastern
Asia
, the
Middle East
,
Europe
,
Africa
,
Australia
, the
United States
, and
Canada
. Headquarters are in
Mumbai
.
The first scheduled service was inaugurated in 1932 by
J.R.D. Tata
, flying mail and passengers between
Karachi
,
Ahmadabad
, Bombay (now Mumbai), Bellary, and
Madras
(now Chennai). By 1939 routes had been extended to Trivandrum,
Delhi
,
Colombo
, Lahore, and intermediate points. After
World War II
, in 1946, Tata Airlines was converted into a
public company
and renamed Air-India Limited. Two years later, to inaugurate international services between Bombay and
Cairo
,
Geneva
, and
London
, Air-India International Limited was formed.
In 1953 India nationalized all Indian airlines, creating two corporations—one for domestic service, called
Indian Airlines Corporation
(merging Air-India Limited with six lesser lines), and one for international service, Air-India International Corporation. The latter’s name was abbreviated to Air-India in 1962. In the following decades as India’s flag carrier, the airline extended its international routes to all continents except
South America
, and it expanded its cargo operations. To gain a competitive advantage in computerized reservation searches, the airline removed the
hyphen
from its name in 2005 to become Air India.
After India began allowing private airlines in 1994, Air India struggled to remain competitive. Despite a significant loss in market share, the corporation was kept bloated with an oversized fleet and
labour force
. It began posting losses in 2007 and merged with Indian Airlines later that year to form National Aviation Company of India Ltd. (NACIL; renamed Air India Ltd. in 2010). After accumulating billions of dollars in debt over the next decade, the government began looking to privatize the company in 2017. After years of little success, the airline was finally sold to the
Tata Group
in 2021.
