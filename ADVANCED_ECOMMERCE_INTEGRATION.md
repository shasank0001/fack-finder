## 🏷️ Risk Scoring & Badges

| Score Range | Badge | Description |
|-------------|-------|-------------|
| 0-25 | ✅ Verified Safe | Legitimate business, safe to proceed |
| 25-45 | 🟢 Low Risk | Generally safe with minor concerns |
| 45-70 | ⚠️ Caution Required | Mixed signals, exercise caution |
| 70-85 | 🔴 High Risk | Multiple red flags, avoid unless verified |
| 85-100 | ⛔ Critical Risk | Likely fraudulent, do not proceed |

## 🛡️ Security Features

### Conservative Safety Gates
- **Phishing Detection**: Subdomain token analysis
- **Typosquatting Prevention**: Brand similarity matching
- **Failure Thresholds**: Multiple analysis failures trigger higher risk
- **Platform Whitelisting**: Trusted platforms get verification bypass

### Verified Major Platforms
- Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra, Ajio, Nykaa
- Meesho, Snapdeal, ShopClues, PaytmMall
- eBay, Alibaba, Walmart, Target, BestBuy
